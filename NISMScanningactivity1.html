										<h1>Scanning Activity 1</h1>
									</header>

									<h2>Task</h2>
									<p>For this acitivty we were required to perform some basic scans on our assigned website using standard tools such as Traceroute to find out:<p>
                  <p>How many hops from your machine to your assigned website?<p>
                  <p>Which step causes the biggest delay in the route? What is the average duration of that delay?<p>
                  <p>What are the main nameservers for the website?<p>
                  <p>Who is the registered contact?<p>
                  <p>What is the MX record for the website?<p>
                  <p>Where is the website hosted?<p>
									
									<h2>Approach</h2>
									
									<p>For this exercise we decided as a group to each have a go at the scanning acitivy and then discuss and agree the results in our following meeting<p>
