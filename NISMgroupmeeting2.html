									<h2>Meeting 2</h2>
									<p>The second meeting was held to begin discussion the assignment requirements.<p>
									
									<h3>Meeting notes shared via google docs</h3>
									
									<p>GROUP 2 meeting held on the 03/04/2022 at 1800hrs<p>
									<p>The discussion started with all the members in attendance;<p>

									<p>Samuel, Beth, Jurbe, Isioma<p>

									<p>Items discussed:<p>
									<p>1. We reviewed an NMAP scan of our website and discussed the vulnerabilities of open ports to be added to the assignment.<p>
                  <p>2. All group members agreed we have been working well as a group and have so far made good progress on the assignment.<p>
                  <p>3. Beth is going to format the assignment as a report to include contents and headings, and add a DREAD analysis to the table - the group will then discuss the risk ratings and agree the order of vulnerabilities by risk.<p> 
                  <p>4. Isioma suggested a summary will be needed to conclude the report - all agreed.<p>
                  <p>5. Once we have completed the report and we are happy we have met the requirements of the assignment we will review any contents that may need to be removed to meet the word count.<p>
                  <p>6. The focus this week will be finishing the report and then next weeks meeting we will complete any seminar preparation.<p>

                  <p>We will meet again next week Sunday by 1800hrs to discuss the progress on the above<p>
