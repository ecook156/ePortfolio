									<h2>Meeting 7</h2>
									<p>This meeting was to focus on the next assignment and what our approach will be<p>
									
									<h3>Meeting notes</h3>
									<p>Group 2 Minutes of the meeting held on 08th May 2022<p>
                  <p>The meeting started at 1900hrs GMT with Vina, Beth, Samuel and Jubet in attendance<p>
                  <p>The meeting was basically to discuss the Development Team Project: Executive Summary in Unit 11.<p>
                  <p>Beth shared a Template for the Executive summary an gave a brief description of the design Template  highlighting the requirements for the Exercise<p>
                  <p>Vina complained on inability to access the site allmytype.co.uk on a few  occasions while trying to perform scans<p>
                  <p>Samuel pointed out that the Nikto scan done by Vina in the last exercise can suffice for the vulnerability identification of the site allmytype.co.uk. The scan featured open ports vulnerabilities, no HTTP X-XSS-Protection etc<p>
                  <p>The Team agreed to base the Executive summary on the Design document submitted in Unit 6 and scanning activity in Unit 7<p>
                  <p>The design document in Unit 6 has highlighted most of the Vulnerabilities identified during the scanning of the website allmytype.co.uk.<p>
                  <p>It was agreed that this exercise will therefore focus more on summarising the vulnerabilities identified in the last exercise, the tools used to identify these vulnerabilities with justification for using these tools. Not all vulnerabilities will be included however, justification will be provided for that<p>
                  <p>The Vulnerabilities identified will be categorised. For example  vulnerabilities like open ports already identified in the last Exercise will be treated as under Security Mis-configuration, improper error handling also under Security mis-configuration<p>
                  <p>Samuel further shared a brief description of improper Error handling highlighting a scenario where wrongly imputed login passwords donâ€™t display the right error messages even after multiple tries<p>
                  <p>It was also noted that the tools used in the last exercise were Kali Linux, Nmap, Nikto, Dmitry hence we will base on our summaries on these tools<p>
                  <p>Jubet noted that the Exercise recommended presentation of results in graphics and charts.<p>
                  <p>The Team agreed to generate graphs that represent a comparative analysis between the tools used for the scanning exercise in Unit 6<p>
                  <p>Also to generate graphs that will show comparative analysis for the vulnerabilities identified in the previous exercise by way of pie charts etc. The goal is to rate these vulnerabilities based on there assessed risk to the site allmytype.co.uk<p>
                  <p>Beth also discussed how the results of the DREAD analysis in the previous exercise  will also be represented graphically<p>
                  <p>Samuel urged The team to make updates to the Template shared by Beth on a regular basis to avoid last minute rush and this was unanimously agreed.<p>
                  <p>The team deliberated on the previous rating and ways to achieve better results in the coming Exercise<p>
                  <p>The next meeting will hold 15th May 2022 at 1600 HRS GMT<p>
                  <p>The meeting ended at 1935 HRS GMT<p>
