                  <h2>End of Unit 7 Reflection</h2>
									
									<p>Learning about the validity of research in this unit was interesting as it is something that I had previously taken for granted, that statistical research carried out would be presented accurately and honestly. Taking part in the collaborative discussions helped me to consider the social, ethical and legal considerations that must take place when conducting statistical research for a company. The overwhelming theme of this discussion was around bias and how this can impact the way results are presented.<p>
                  <p>I found this unit quite difficult in terms of the activities to be completed, the collaborative discussion and the deadline for the first summative assignment, therefore I chose to focus on the assignment completion first, as I knew I could come back to the formative work, to ensure I had full focus on the summative.<p>
