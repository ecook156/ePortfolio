                  <h2>End of Unit 1 Reflection</h2>
									
									<p>This unit covered an introduction to ACM computing code of ethics (ACM, 2018) and BCS code of conduct (BCS, 2022), these were both new concepts to me and upon reading seemed relatively straight forward in terms of being honest, treating other with respect and doing the right thing. However, reviewing the case studies and analysis from collaborative discussion 1 showed how these codes could be compromised easily although maybe not intentionally. They are important concepts to ensure the computing profession is held accountable and is an enjoyable place for everyone to work in and has made me want to ensure I am the best computing professional I can be by following the codes through study and at work.<p>
