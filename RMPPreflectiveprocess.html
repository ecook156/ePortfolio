                  <h2>Reflective Process</h2>
									
									<p>Reflective writing is a method used by academics to help in planning for professional development (Nesi, 2007) and it is seen as an important feature of a portfolio to show identification and understanding of a student’s learning process (Kathpalia & Heah, 2008). <p>
                  <p>Throughout the 12-week Research Methods and Professional Practices module, reflections on each unit will be documented weekly which is evidenced to ensure a significant improvement in the ability to reflect over time (Minnes et al, 2017) and reflecting on the knowledge learnt so far, can result in a deeper understanding of a topic (Shum et al, 2017). Further reflections will be carried out after feedback from each summative activity to ensure lessons are learnt and carried forward to the following summative, thus ensuring an improvement in the grade based on feedback. The final reflection, capped at 1000 words, will then take highlights from the previous reflections throughout and the overall reflection of the module and process of learning.<p>
                  <p>Whilst reflective writing can provide an opportunity to learn, it can often become a descriptive list of tasks that have been completed and there is little awareness of the stages that should be included (King, 2002). In order to get the most out of this process there must be some evaluation and analysis during the reflection in order to understand what went well and what can be improved rather than just what was done. <p>
                  <p>To ensure there is structure to each of the reflections (Husebo et al, 2015) they will each follow Gibbs’ Reflective Cycle (1988). This will ensure each reflection is concise and focused on the relevant topic whilst ensuring each aspect of a reflection is covered (Adeani et al, 2020). Gibbs Reflective Cycle prompts the writer through 6 stages of reflection ensuring it does not end up being a description of events.<p>
