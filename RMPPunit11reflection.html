                  <h2>End of Unit 11 Reflection</h2>
									
									<p>The ePortfolio is something I had previously completed for other modules in the Cyber Security MSc course, however, there hadn’t been as much emphasis on the importance of it or the benefits of keeping one throughout studying. This unit highlighted the benefits not only for higher education but also in the workplace (Ring et al, 2017) and the impact they can have on learning and development.<p>
                  <p>Although I already had an ePortfolio created, I spent this unit ensuring it was up to date and creating a list of all of the items throughout the module I wanted to make sure I included. I had kept up to date throughout the course with the majority of the ePortfolio, seminar and reflective activities including completing a short reflection at the end of each unit, this made the process of gathering all of this information much simpler and I didn’t have too much to catch up on apart from drafting the final graded reflection. <p>
