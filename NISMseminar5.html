										<h1>Seminar 5: Data Breach Case Study</h1>
									</header>

									<h2>Equifax Data Breach - May 2017</h2>
									<p>For this seminar we were to read Read Swinhoe, D., 2020. The 15 Biggest Data Breaches Of The 21St Century. [online] CSO Online. We then selected a case study from the options and reviewed the data breach that occured by asnwering some questions for discussion.<p>
									
									<h3>Summary</h3>
									
									<p>Equifax was using an open-source software (Apache Struts) to help employees and consumers manage credit disputes.<p>
                  <p>Apache released a major update for the Struts program in March, 2017 due to a security flaw in the software.<p>
                  <p>They urged IT managers to update immediately to patch the flaw but Equifax did not deploy the latest update and was therefore left vulnerable.<p>
                  <p>The breach wasn't discovered until July 2017 and had lasted for 76 days before Equifax patched the exploit.<p>
                  <p>It was also discovered that the personal information held was not encrypted.<p>
                  
                  <h3>What types of data were affected?</h3>
                  <p>Criminals first targeted the login credentials of Equifax employees.<p>
                  <p>This allowed them to search credit reports and other consumer data as authorised users.<p>
                  <p>The cybercriminals ran a search of more than 9000 consumer records.<p>
                  <p>Most of the information compromised was first and last names, social security numbers, addresses, and driver’s license numbers.<p>
                  <p>The exposure of all of this data could lead to identity and credit card fraud.<p>
                  
                  <h3>Were any escalation(s) stopped - how?</h3>
                  <p>The result of the Equifax breach was mainly due to not maintaining and updating their systems and applications with the latest updates and security patches.<p>

                  <h3>Were the ICO notified?</h3>
                  <p>The ICO were notified and issued a penalty of £500,000 under section 55a of the Data Protection Act 1998<p>
                  <p>The commissioner found that Equifax did not take appropriate technical and organisational measures to prevent the unlawful processing of data (ICO, 2017)<p>
                  <p>As this breach pre dated GDPR the fine was less that it would have been if it happened today.<p>

                  <h3>Was the Business Continuity Plan instigated?</h3>
                  <p>No - part of the cause of the breach was that Equifax had a lack of breach detection protocols.<p>

                  <h3>Were affected individuals notified?</h3>
                  <p>Equifax went public about the breach in September 2017 - it's not clear how and when customer affected were notified<p>
                  
                  <h3>If you had been the ISM for the organisation you selected, what mitigations would you have put in place to stop any recurrences?</h3>
                  <p>Ensure there was an appropriate patch management and upgrade process in place to maintain all of the systems and deploy any updates as soon as possible.<p> 
                  <p>Role based access control for personal information could have helped deter the attackers or made it more difficult for them to exploit the information.<p>
                  <p>The personal data stored should always be encrypted, so it there is a breach, it is unlikely to be deciphered.<p>
                  <p>All experian employees should receive at least annual security and data protection training to enforce why these actions are important.<p>
