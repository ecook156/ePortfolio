                  <h2>Reflective Activity 1 - Ethics in Computing</h2>
									
									<h3>Introduction</h3>
									
									<p>Ethics in computing has been a topic of discussion for many years, since the invention of computers there have been concerns around social and ethical issues that the new technology could cause (Johnson & Miller, 2004) and as computers have provided new technology and capabilities, there are choices that must be made on how this technology is used (Moor, 2017) to ensure it is moral and ethical. The need for ethics in computing has resulted in multiple professional bodies producing principles and codes of conduct for how computing professionals should behave within their field such as ACMs Code of Ethics (ACM, 2018) and BCS Code of Conduct (BCS, 2022). Although these codes provide guidance on how computing professionals should behave, there are also issues with ethics that need to be considered. Stahl et al (2016) discusses the key ethical issues and relevant technologies that need to be better understood by relevant stakeholders in the computing profession to ensure the technical experts are aware of the consequences of their work.<p>
                  
                  <h3>Legal Issues</h3>
                  
                  <p>One of the issues discussed are the legal issues in computing. This refers to issues that are impacted by formal regulation and law (Stahl et al, 2016). Whilst the legal framework often has similarities with morals and ethics, legislation is legally binding and can be enforced or used for punishment when not followed, unlike that of computing ethics. Stahl et al (2016) mentions the issue of privacy which as stated in the Human Rights Act (1998) “everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence” and as technologies evolve privacy issues are of the upmost importance (Johnson & Miller, 2004).<p>
                  <p>Many roles in IT may come with privileges in which you may have access to personal information, such as other employee’s data and this information could be used for company research. However, this should not be carried out unless there is a reason for doing so and the employee has given consent otherwise access to this information could be unlawful. This is pertinent in the healthcare sector where access to systems can provide insight into extremely sensitive patient information (Jayabalan & O’Daniel, 2016).<p>
                  <p>Due to this, many organisations will have detailed policies and procedures for going about this if access to information is needed, as a stakeholder it is important to follow the correct procedure, to protect yourself from legal ramifications. Taking extra steps to confirm that the consent and requirements are in place to access someone’s data could involve speaking to legal and HR teams to ensure the correct employment contracts are in place to cover consent and confirming with the requester that there is a legitimate need to view this information (Data Protection Act, 2018). Although this process will add additional time and effort to the deliverable of providing the data, it is necessary to ensure it is ethical and in line with the law.<p>
                  <p>Understanding the legal impact of your actions is vital as a computing stakeholder so as not to act in a way that could cause harm to yourself or the company in which you work for. Failure to do so could result in the company being in breach of both the Human Rights Act (1998) and the Data Protection Act (2018) which could lead to fines and brand damage.<p>
                  
                  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                  
                  <p>Although computing ethics provide strong guidance for professionals and their stakeholders that should be followed, it should be done in conjunction with the law and ensuring that legislation is also adhered to. The ramifications of not considering legal issues will be more severe for companies that the codes of ethics.<p>
