										<h1>Unit 8 - How to Evaluate and Apply Applicable Security Standards</h1>
									</header>

									<p>This unit focused on reviewing security and industry standards and how these could be applied to case studies and our assigned website.<p>
									
									<h2>Collaborative Discussion 3</h2>
									<p>For this discussion we had to chose a case study from a list and review it against the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The intial post had to cover which areas or GDPR were discussed in the case study, how it was resolved and what we would do as an information security manager to mitigate against the breach from occuring.<p> 
                						
									
									<h3>Initial Post</h3>
									<p>I chose the case study ‘Disclosure of sensitive data by a hospital to a third party’ which reports on a patient’s medical report being read by a third party due to a clerical error with the way in which the hospital administrative staff envelope and post their patients’ medical reports.<p>
									<p>The commissioner found breaches of 3 articles, which relate to the accuracy principle, 5(1)d mandating that personal information should be accurate and kept up to date (GDPR, 2018), this was not the case due to the patient’s address being incorrectly written. The lawfulness principle, set out in Article 6 of the GDPR stating there must be a legal basis for processing of personal information (GDPR, 2018). In the case of the third party who read the patients’ medical report they did not have consent, contract, legal obligation, vital interests, public task or legitimate interest to read this medical information. Finally, the case study covers the security principle, and that processing of personal data must be done securely by means of ‘appropriate technical and organisational measures’ (GDPR, 2018)<p>
									<p>In order to mitigate against this risk, the latter of the 3 principles should be addressed first. By implementing better security policies and procedures along with security awareness training the organisation can reduce the internal threat of poor user security behaviours (Leach, 2003), demonstrate they have appropriate ‘organisational measures’(GDPR, 2018), and the improved training will reduce the likelihood of an administrative error which caused the inaccurate address to be written.<p>
									<p>A further step that should be taken would be to reduce the risk of human error by implementing a secure mail system which sends the medical reports from the hospital to the recipient, similar to that of the NHS mail system used to refer patients to GP practices. This removes the risks associated with using post by ensuring an audit trail, including encryption to make data only available to those that should see it and further reduces the risk of human error which is one of the most overlooked causes of privacy breaches (Liginlal, 2009). The business can then demonstrate they have ‘appropriate technical’ measures are in place. Although the risk cannot be completely removed, by taking these steps to demonstrate action to secure the patients data, it puts the organisation in a more defensible position should another breach occur.<p>

									<p>Hi Elizabeth. This was an interesting case study. It is hard to imagine modern organizations still hand writing envelopes, yet here we are. Implementing security controls over manual processes is very difficult. I used to work for a large insurance company back when they would still take printouts of policy statements and hand stuff the envelopes. We had a notorious problem with "double stuffing"; putting two printouts from different customers into the same envelope.<p>
									<p>I really appreciate your recommendation to move to a secure email system instead of mailing statements. However, moving to email does introduce a new potential risk that needs to be resolved, which is the problem of data retention and data erasion. Because Article 17 of the GDPR allows data subjects to request the erasure of their personal data, organizations must ensure that they are able to locate and delete all copies of emails which contain personal data (gdpr.eu, 2018).<p>

									<h3>Elizabeth Cook - Response back to Kevin</h3>
									<p>Hi Kevin, Thank you for your response, I do agree that data retention is a problem for organisations and being able to ensure they do not keep data for longer than needed and that it is erased when required (GDPR, 2018) becomes an issue with emails due to data being sent to multiple people or being stored on local devices which makes erasure from everywhere almost impossible. However, with paper records destruction needs to be manual and so does the review of the age of the data. With electronic information it can be filtered or automated in some way to include periodic deletion (Hossain, 2019) in accordance with the retention period whereas paper records could also be stored somewhere for years after they are required without knowing because there is no way to set up alerts or automatic deletion.<p>

									<p>Hi, It is worth mentioning that the erasure of personal data may give better result for a paper document than for an electronic media. While paper mails can be burnt to ashes and rendered irredeemable, it is possible to still retrieve deleted data on an electronic media (ICO, 2014). This may present a concern on privacy especially as you have noted that data could be stored on local devices which makes erasure from everywhere almost impossible. A deleted document may still exist, in some form or another within an electronic media and can be retrieved provided it has not been over-written(Tabona, 2019).<p>
									<p>Thankfully however, The ICO acknowledges this possibility and will be satisfied that information has been ‘put beyond use’, if not actually deleted, provided that the data controller holding it:<p>
									<p>•	is not able, or will not attempt, to use the personal data to inform any decision in respect of any individual or in a manner that affects the individual in any way;<p>
									<p>•	does not give any other organisation access to the personal data;<p>
									<p>•	surrounds the personal data with appropriate technical and organisational security; and<p>
									<p>•	commits to permanent deletion of the information if, or when, this becomes possible (ICO, 2014)<p>
									<p>The ICO also noted that there are situations where archival of personal data is being confused with the deletion of personal data or vice versa and recommends that data controllers should make it clear to the subjects, what will happen to their records when for example, an account is closed; if it will be irretrievable or simply deactivated or archived (ICO, 2014)<p>

									<p>Thank for your thoughtful submission. Indeed, the implementation of appropriate organizational measures like staff training to educate about the privacy requirements of GDPR and the penalties that may be meted in case of breach, privacy policy to guide all staff on handling of sensitive personal data. However, the process in the case study is not fully automated and therefore will make it difficult for the organization to identify breaches and close gaps accordingly.<p>
