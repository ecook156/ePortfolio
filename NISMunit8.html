										<h1>Unit 8 - How to Evaluate and Apply Applicable Security Standards</h1>
									</header>

									<p>This unit focused on reviewing security and industry standards and how these could be applied to case studies and our assigned website.<p>
									
									<h2>Collaborative Discussion 3</h2>
									<p>For this discussion we had to chose a case study from a list and review it against the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The intial post had to cover which areas or GDPR were discussed in the case study, how it was resolved and what we would do as an information security manager to mitigate against the breach from occuring.<p> 
                								
									<li><a href="#">Case Study</a></li>
									
									<h3>Initial Post</h3>
									<p>I chose the case study ‘Disclosure of sensitive data by a hospital to a third party’ which reports on a patient’s medical report being read by a third party due to a clerical error with the way in which the hospital administrative staff envelope and post their patients’ medical reports.<p>
									<p>The commissioner found breaches of 3 articles, which relate to the accuracy principle, 5(1)d mandating that personal information should be accurate and kept up to date (GDPR, 2018), this was not the case due to the patient’s address being incorrectly written. The lawfulness principle, set out in Article 6 of the GDPR stating there must be a legal basis for processing of personal information (GDPR, 2018). In the case of the third party who read the patients’ medical report they did not have consent, contract, legal obligation, vital interests, public task or legitimate interest to read this medical information. Finally, the case study covers the security principle, and that processing of personal data must be done securely by means of ‘appropriate technical and organisational measures’ (GDPR, 2018)<p>
									<p>In order to mitigate against this risk, the latter of the 3 principles should be addressed first. By implementing better security policies and procedures along with security awareness training the organisation can reduce the internal threat of poor user security behaviours (Leach, 2003), demonstrate they have appropriate ‘organisational measures’(GDPR, 2018), and the improved training will reduce the likelihood of an administrative error which caused the inaccurate address to be written.<p>
									<p>A further step that should be taken would be to reduce the risk of human error by implementing a secure mail system which sends the medical reports from the hospital to the recipient, similar to that of the NHS mail system used to refer patients to GP practices. This removes the risks associated with using post by ensuring an audit trail, including encryption to make data only available to those that should see it and further reduces the risk of human error which is one of the most overlooked causes of privacy breaches (Liginlal, 2009). The business can then demonstrate they have ‘appropriate technical’ measures are in place. Although the risk cannot be completely removed, by taking these steps to demonstrate action to secure the patients data, it puts the organisation in a more defensible position should another breach occur.<p>
