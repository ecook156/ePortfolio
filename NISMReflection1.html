									<h2>Reflection 1 - End of unit 3</h2>
                  
                  <h3>Reflection on group work week 1, 2 and 3</h3>
									<h4>Description</h4>
                  <p>For this module we were allocated into groups in order to complete two of the graded assignments. I was put in group 2 with 3 other people which comprised of students from 3 different countries. I reached out to each of the team members via the learning platform to make initial contact and agreed I would set up a WhatsApp group to make regular communication easy. I was nominated to take the role as team lead and subsequently took charge of creating the team contract, uploading and sharing documents via google docs and suggesting the focus for the first few team meetings.<p>
                  <h4>Feelings</h4>
                  <p>Upon learning about the group assignment part of the module I was initially concerned. Firstly I was worried about the logistics of working with other people remotely especially in an environment where we are all working full time and juggling study to suit my needs is hard enough without having to also factor 3 other people into the work. Secondly I was also concerned about the level of engagement from the other team members and whether the quality of the assignments would be as good, this came from experiences at undergraduate level where I had group assignments that did not go as well as my individual tasks.<p>
                  <h4>Evaluation</h4>
                  <p>So far, my experience in group 2 has been much better than expected and I can see the benefit of this type of working. In order to overcome the time management aspect, we set out an agreed weekly meeting time where we would all come together to review work, we had done in the previous 7 days and also to discuss any seminar preparation required. Having a set time meant I could still be relatively flexible around my full-time job the rest of the week as long as I hit that deadline of completion before the weekly meeting. I have also been pleased with how working as a group has made completion of the assignment a relatively quick task and has allowed me to learn from students with different expertise to myself who have therefore suggested ideas and conclusions that I may not have come to on my own.<p>
                  <h4>Analysis</h4>
                  <p>On reflection of my initial feelings towards the group work compared with how the work is going after 3 weeks, I can see that my view of group work was tarnished by the experiences I had as an undergraduate student. Whilst I had negative experiences in earlier years, I should have realised that the people on this course studying a part time masterâ€™s degree are likely to take the assignments more seriously based on their experience and the level we are working at.<p>
                  <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                  <p>I am pleased with the progress group 2 is making so far and this experience has shown me that there can be positives of working in a group. Whilst I may still prefer the flexibility of individual studies, the knowledge and ideas that come from sharing discussions with other people add to the learning opportunities and enable me to learn from others as well as the online material.<p>
                  <h4>Action Plan</h4>
                  <p>1.	Continue with regular weekly meetings and ensuring I complete individual studies ahead of our group discussions in order to provide valuable input.<p>
                  <p>2.	Be more open minded about upcoming group assignments throughout the course and make the most of the opportunity to learn from other students with different experiences.<p>
