									<h2>Collaborative Learning Discussion 1</h2>
									<p>For this discussion we were required to response to our peers intial posts regarding the artile by Glisson et al (2015) on Compromising a Medical Mannequin<p>
									
									<h3>Peer Response 1</h3>
									
									<p>I agree that due to the size of the memory included in the devices it can be difficult to use stronger encryption methods. Ometov et al (2019) argues that the key to securing IOT devices is through authentication by various smart devices. Many IOT devices already use multi factor authentication therefore it is a method than can be included in the access to most devices. This will significantly reduce the possibility of a successful brute force attack as an attacker would need the secondary method of authentication which would be more difficult to intercept due to the short expiration of a one time pass. (Borgohain et al, 2015)<p>
									<p>I agree with Jonathan that network segmentation is a good option to secure IOT devices by separating iStan devices onto separate VLANs it restricts the movement of a cyber attacker making it difficult to access multiple resources (Wagner et al, 2016). While network segmentation may not prevent a DoS attack it significantly reduces the impact to the business if one was to happen, when it comes to the use of medical devices, continuity of service and the ability to carry on with operations quickly after an attack is key.<p>

									<h3>Peer Response 2</h3>
										
									<p>I do agree that Glisson et al. do not specifically call out any threats in their paper, through assessing the vulnerabilities discussed, we can identify what threats might occur (Campbell, 2016). By following Microsoft’s STRIDE model of Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service and Elevation of Privilege (Meier et al, 2003) it becomes clear that there is a significant threat of a Denial of Service attack based on the paper already proving this is achievable through the opensource tools described in your initial post. A denial of service attack has a huge impact on the availability of service which can then lead to both financial and societal consequences (Kaur Chahal et al, 2019).<p> 
 									<p>As you also pointed out, there have already been notifications about threats to medical devices. While the security vulnerabilities described in the paper are similar to problems with any other networked system, the potential detrimental impact on patient safety makes targets on medical devices more of a concern (Williams & Woodward, 2015). Based on this it must be assumed that the likelihood of this threat being realised is high, coupled with the vulnerability already being proven as exploitable, a denial of service threat should be the focus of mitigation activities.<p>

									<h3>Peer Response 3</h3>
									<p>I really enjoyed your post which not only pointed out the technical vulnerabilities but also how people and process vulnerabilities can affect the security of an organisation (Campbell, 2016). ISO27001:2013 describes a vulnerability as a weakness of an asset or control that can be exploited (ISO, 2013) and therefore identifying the need for good security culture in the company is also key to reducing the threats.<p>
									<p>As you mentioned, one of the ways to secure the environment against the technical vulnerabilities described would be to have first identified these through penetration testing. This can help an organisation to mitigate against potential issues by taking remedial action before they are found and exploited by a malicious actor. This can then be taken further by implementing a procedure to incorporate frequent pen testing of different devices and systems, perhaps on an annual basis, so that the organisation can keep on top new vulnerabilities that may become present following any changes in the network or infrastructure.<p>
									<p>Although it must always be considered that while penetration testing helps to identify flaws in a system, it does not guarantee that all possible vulnerabilities will be found (Bishop, 2007) which is why implementing an Information Security Management System to conduct regular testing is required to ensure continued protection.<p>
