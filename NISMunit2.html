									<h2>Collaborative Learning Discussion 1</h2>
									<p>For this discussion we were required to response to our peers intial posts regarding the artile by Glisson et al (2015) on Compromising a Medical Mannequin<p>
									
									<p>Peer Response 1<p>
									
									<p>I agree that due to the size of the memory included in the devices it can be difficult to use stronger encryption methods. Ometov et al (2019) argues that the key to securing IOT devices is through authentication by various smart devices. Many IOT devices already use multi factor authentication therefore it is a method than can be included in the access to most devices. This will significantly reduce the possibility of a successful brute force attack as an attacker would need the secondary method of authentication which would be more difficult to intercept due to the short expiration of a one time pass. (Borgohain et al, 2015)<p>
									<p>I agree with Jonathan that network segmentation is a good option to secure IOT devices by separating iStan devices onto separate VLANs it restricts the movement of a cyber attacker making it difficult to access multiple resources (Wagner et al, 2016). While network segmentation may not prevent a DoS attack it significantly reduces the impact to the business if one was to happen, when it comes to the use of medical devices, continuity of service and the ability to carry on with operations quickly after an attack is key.<p>
