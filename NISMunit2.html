									<h2>Collaborative Learning Discussion 1</h2>
									<p>For this discussion we were required to response to our peers intial posts regarding the artile by Glisson et al (2015) on Compromising a Medical Mannequin<p>
									
									<p>Peer Response 1<p>
									
									<p>With the increased use and dependency on technology in medical settings, the potential for a malicious cyber-attack has become more of a concern (Glisson et al, 2015). The article on Compromising a Medical Mannequin identifies vulnerabilities of the iStan device and how these can be exploited.<p>
 									<p>There were two technical vulnerabilities identified in the paper, firstly, the network security solution consisted of wireless transmissions between the controlling laptop and mannequins internal access point. Using open-source tools, students were able to carry out a brute force attack to crack the PIN on the access point. Following a brute force attack of this nature there is a threat of tampering with the devices used by the training facility by making unauthorised changes to the information (Campbell, 2016) thus affecting the integrity of the iStan devices. The impact of these vulnerabilities being realised could influence medical professionals to incorrectly assess a situation (Glisson et al, 2015) Therefore mitigation steps could be put in place by disabling the WPS from the access point consequently removing the ability to use the Reaver tools used in the research.<p>
 									<p>Secondly, the network protocol used was found to be vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack. This attack made the iStan devices unable to receive any setting changes from the muse software causing a threat to the availability of the devices which would impact the medical staffs ability to train effectively. Householder et al (2001) argues that proper preparation is essential for effective detection and reaction of a denial-of-service attack therefore a two step approach should be taken to implement firewalls to prevent a Denial of service attack from occurring and also having a robust Disaster Recovery plan in place to quickly react and reduce the impact of the threat if an attack was successful.<p>
