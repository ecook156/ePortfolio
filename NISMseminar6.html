									<h2>Task</h2>
									<p>For the final seminar we were to read the following two articles. Rawat, D. & Reddy, S. (2017). Software Defined Networking Architecture, Security and Energy Efficiency: A Survey. IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials 19(1):325-346. & Ding, W., Yan, Z. & Deng, R. (2016) A Survey on Future Internet Security Architectures. IEEE Access. and then debate in our group for our given argument.<p>
									<p>In our group we discussed the possible arguments for our belief and then each sleected one topis as our focus for the debate<p>
									
									<h2>Group 2: It is our belief that the future of the Internet is based on peer-to-peer overlay-based networking (BitTorrent, TOR, Freenet, KAD).</h2>
									
									<h3>Group 2: My opening argument</h3>
									<p>It is our belief that the future of the Internet is based on peer-to-peer overlay-based networking (BitTorrent, TOR, Freenet, KAD). A peer to peer (P2P) overlay network is a network built on top of the internet which allows sharing of information without the use of IP addresses and provides a good option for large scale data sharing and content distribution (Eng Keong Lua et al, 2005).<p>
									<p>Internet of Things (IOT) devices generate a vast amount of data over the internet and therefore require architecture that can support the retrieval and efficient storage of this data, peer to peer network overlay is an attractive choice for this due to the decentralised nature (Djellabi et al, 2020). With the increase of Internet of Things (IOT) devices it is becoming increasingly important for the architecture the internet is based to be able to accommodate this level of demand and state of the art IOT services (Oktian, 2021) therefore moving towards an architecture that can support this area of growth is sensible.<p> 
									<p>Peer to peer network overlay based networks can be easily scaled, as the information is distributed among many objects, but this also ensures there is no single point of failure (Kamel et al, 2019) which supports the availability of the network which is another factor to be considered given the large number of IOT devices reliant on network that can meet their demands.<p>

									<h3>Group 2: Samuel's opening argument</h3>
									<p>The peer-to-peer system is built on the principle of decentralisation. The blockchain design allows all cryptocurrencies to be exchanged instantaneously without middlemen, intermediaries, or an intermediary server. Anyone can set up a Bitcoin node to verify and validate blocks as a distributed peer-to-peer network. A blockchain is a peer-to-peer network-based distributed ledger that tracks one or more digital assets (Avron, 2021). All computers in a peer-to-peer network are linked. Each computer keeps a complete copy of the ledger and compares it to others to assure data accuracy, making it highly available.<p>
				 					<p>Unlike banks, where transactions are privately stored and controlled solely by the banks, a central authority prevents users from being censored by user-to-user blockchain architecture. In addition, unlike conventional bank accounts, virtual currency wallets cannot be frozen or emptied by banks or governments.<p>
 									<p>The other peers are still present because of the P2P networking capability, even if one peer gets down. Thus, nobody can take down the blockchain. It's also very impossible to change the original file because most client hard drives must establish consensus with one another before a transaction can be completed.<p>
									<p>Immutability is a feature of blockchain, which means that data can't be wiped or replaced after it's been written, traditional databases lack immutability, making them more vulnerable to tampering by a rogue administrator or third-party hackers (Sharma, 2020).<p>
									<p>With cloud computing, you must rely on AWS and Google Drives. However, with blockchain, because it uses peer-to-peer networking, you do not need to rely on third parties, which can alter your data. Unfortunately, such networks are not immune to censorship by central authorities.<p>
 									<p>When paired with a majority consensus requirement, the distributed peer-to-peer network gives blockchains a relatively high degree of resistance to malicious activity like the Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks due to its decentralised architecture (Koegel, Hong Heather Yu and Eng Keong Lua, 2009).<p>
 									<p>However, the peer-to-peer nature of blockchain networks creates few concerns. Distributed ledgers must be updated on every node, similar to blockchain, and adding transactions needs a significant amount of processing resources. Although this increases security, it also affects efficiency, one of the key barriers to scaling and widespread use.<p>

									<h3>Group 2: Jurbe's opening argument</h3>
									<p>Communication between connected devices in the internet has evolved because of the rapid growth of the internet such that the current physical architecture which uses the IP addressing system is unable to cater for various needs of these devices. Distributed systems face a challenge with this structure since every packet sent over the internet will require a source and destination address thus, limiting the versatility of this type of system (Ding et al, 2016).<p>
									<p>Peer-to-peer network overlays have a major advantage of decentralizing communication, and fit technologies that are based on distributed systems (iQra, 2016). Overlay networks are networks that are configured on top of an existing physical network architecture and peer -to- peer networks provide for communication between peers over these overlays, without a centralized controlling body (iQra, 2016). <p>
									<p>There are many advantages of the peer-to-peer overlay networks that project it as a suitable solution for future network advancements. Decentralisation in peer - peer networks offer great advantage because it has no single point of failure, and that is why emerging internet technologies like block chain, IoT and BitTorrent, take advantage of this feature (Kranz, 2020).<p>

									<h3>Group 2: Isioma's opening argument</h3>
									<p>Peer-to-peer has become a significant social and technical phenomenon over the past year. Today's computing and communications environments are more complex and chaotic than classical distributed systems, without any centralised hierarchy or organisation.<p>
									<p>Peer-to-peer networks are an excellent foundation for large-scale data sharing and multicast applications at the application level.<p>
									<p>These networks have the potential to be an efficient routing system, self-organising, immensely scalable, and incredibly resilient. In addition, they integrate fault tolerance, load balancing, and a clear sense of location.<p>
									<p>Various features are available on these Peer-to-peer networks, including selecting nearby peers, redundant storage, efficient searches and finding of data items, data permanence and authentication, hierarchical naming, and anonymity (e.g., FreeNet).<p>
									<P>First of all, let us take an example from BitTorrent; Users can use BitTorrent to transfer data and electronic files over the Internet using the peer-to-peer file-sharing protocol. This enables users to distribute data and electronic files over the Internet decentralised. This app is available for a variety of computing platforms and operating systems.<p>
									<p>"Torrenting", As it is called, should be approached with caution because  BitTorrent  Peer-to-peer networking may offer a convenient way to share files. Unfortunately, it has also resulted in a great deal of software piracy and illegal downloads where modified clients may not follow the standard protocol, and data stored on remote computers may be disclosed.<p>
									<p>However, each new user must obtain an identity certificate digitally signed by a central authority to prove their identity. For example, a user signs a message with his private key and attaches a certificate signed by the CA. Strong identities prevent Sybil Attacks; if an attacker is caught, it cannot easily rejoin the system.<p>
