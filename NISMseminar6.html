									<h2>Collaborative Learning Discussion 2</h2>
									<p>For the final part of this discussion we were to proivde a summary post based on our intial post and responses from peers<p> 
									
									<h3>Summary Post</h3>
									
									<p>My initial post covered my approach to the scanning activity which was relatively straight forward and resulted in the same findings as my group and other peers. After reviewing other discussion around the same topic it made me further question my results.<p>
                  <p>Klacar (2022) raised informative points around latency and that the having increased latency in the earlier hops can indicate an issue with the local network (ServiceNow, 2021) others also discussed that latency can be impacted by the use of a VPN (Ashmore, 2022) or because of firewalls (Angelides, 2022). Based on this added information and a further review of my initial findings found that my quickest hops were at the start of the traceroute scan, indicating a good network connection, and my slowest ones were the middle to end of the scan which could be due to the network connection at the server end or the location but as so many different variables can potentially impact the latency between hops it is difficult to pinpoint the factor in this case.<p>
                  <p>My initial post also raised the potential risk around having all servers based in the same location by the same hosting company however after further research Peuhkurinen (2022) pointed out that the company promotes their DNS system as providing ‘unparalleled redundancy’ (Cloudflare, 2019). Whilst this may be one of the company’s unique selling points, there is still a risk of having all webservers hosted by the same company in the same location as there is a single point of failure.<p>
                  <p>Finally, the discussion also evidenced how many readily available tools and options there are for performing these types of scans and for finding out information about a site that could be used by an attacker.<p>
