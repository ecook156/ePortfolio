									<h2>Collaborative Learning Discussion 2</h2>
									<p>For this discussion we had ro review the case study around accuracy of information<p>
									
									<h3>Peer Responses</h3>
                  
                  <h3>Peer Response 1 to Alberto Rossotto</h3>
        			
									<p>I agree that bias towards the results is highly possible by the manufacturer as they have a preconceived belief that their cereal is nutritious, and they will want this to be the outcome (Gluud, 2006). Therefor there is a risk that if they received both negative and positive results from the research, they would likely want to only use the positive side for advertising of their product as this aligns with that they want the research to achieve.<p>
                  <p>However, as an independent statistical programmer, Abi is unlikely to be affected by research bias unless he has been influenced by the sponsors of the work (Wilholt, 2008). It could be argued that in Whizzz commissioning Abi to research the nutritious value of the cereal there is an indication that they want these results to be positive. Whilst it is difficult to reduce bias (Sica, 2006) the use of the statistical programme should remove some of the human element that could cause bias.<p>

                  <p>You make an interesting point about the legal implications of Abi presenting deceptive or misleading information about the product (Roongta, 2023) however as long as the information that Abi has provided is factually accurate then he has done the job requested of him and would not be legally liable.<p>
                  <p>It is up to Whizzz to ensure their advertising meets the correct legal standards and that they do not portray information in a misleading way that could falsely influence their consumers. The Advertising Standards Agency (2023) requires that marketing must not mislead consumers therefore in order for Whizzz to ensure they are meeting these standards, with regards to the nutritional value of their product, it is vital that Abi has shared all of his findings with the company for them to make the correct claims. If this has been done transparently and Whizzz still choose to use deceptive marketing (Danciu, 2014), Abi should be safe from legal implications as it could be proven he provided accurate research.<p>
