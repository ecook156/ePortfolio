                  <h2>End of Unit 5 Reflection</h2>
									
									<p>This unit looked into research methodologies and the techniques available for conducting primary research the difference between interviews and surverys and how they might be used for different scenarios. The reflective activity allowed me to give deeper thought into the appropriate use for survey responses and how consent must be given (Data Protection Act, 2018) to ensure the responder knows how their information will be used (Dawson, 2015) this will be key for any primary research carried out for the capstone project however this will not be put into practice for this module as all summative activities only require secondary research.<p>
                  <p>Feedback on the literature review outline was also provided during this unit, I found this process extremely useful, as I have not completed a literature review before, therefore it was helpful to receive feedback that confirmed I was on the right track for my review and some advice on how to ensure a successful outcome.<p>
