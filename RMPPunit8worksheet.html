                  <h3>Evidence</h3>

                  <h3>Observations</h3>
                  <p>Overall, on average the dieters following diet A lost more weight than those following diet B as the mean for diet A was 5.342 compared with only 3.710 for diet B therfore suggesting it is a more effective diet.<p>
                  <p>However the standard deviation for diet A is also smaller than diet B meaning there is a smaller spread of results and more dieters had a positive weightloss within the range than those on diet B. Also confirming it is a more effective diet.<p>
                  
                  <h2>Excercise 8.2B</h2>
                  
                  <h3>Evidence</h3>

                  <h3>Observations</h3>
                  <p>The interquartile range shows the spread of the middle half of the distribution for both diet A and diet B. As the IQR is higher for diet B it suggests a larger range of weightlosses between the lower and upper quartiles. This further demonstrated that diet A is more effective as the IQR will sit more around the median figure which is higher for diet A meaning more people with on diet A had on average a larger weightloss than those on diet B.<p>
               
								 <h2>Excercise 8.4G</h2>
                  
                  <h3>Evidence</h3>
						
								  <p><img src="images/8.4G.png"
									width="500" 
   									height="400"><p>	
                  
                  <h3>Observations</h3>
                  <p>The samle mean number of impurties present after filtration was 8.25 (parts per 1000) for Agent 1 and 8.68 (parts per 1000) for Agent 2. The data therfore has found significant evidence that Agent 1 resulted in less impurities being left in the product and was therfore a better filter agent by 0.43 (parts per 1000) and should be the Agent chosen for filtration as it is more effective at removal.<p>
                  <p>Based on a one tailed test of Agent 1 the results show that t= -3.264 with 11 degrees of freedom and the  associated one tailed p-value is p=0.004. The obsereved p value is significant although a higher level of significance was obtained with the one tailed test.<p>
                  
                  <h2>Excercise 8.6C</h2>
                  
                  <h3>Evidence</h3>
						
								  <p><img src="images/8.6C.png"
									width="500" 
   									height="400"><p>	
                  
                  <h3>Observations</h3>
                  <p>The sample variances for male and female are 233.129 and 190.176 retrospectivly. The observed F test statistic is 1.226 with 59 and 59 degrees of freedom giving a two tailed p-value of p=0.436. The F ratio is not significant therefore the data is consistent with the assumption that the population variances underlying the income between male and female do not differ and are independant.<p>
                  <p>The data shows that the mean income for Males was 52.91 (in £000s) and for Females was 44.23 (in £000s) therfore meaning mens income was higher by an estimated mean of 8.68 annually (in £000s)<p>
