									<h2>Collaborative Discussion 3</h2>
									<p>For this week were required to respond to our peers intial posts based on their chosen case study<p> 
                
									<h3>Peer Response 1</h3>
									<p>Hi Jurbe, Thank you for your post, when it comes to article 32 of GDPR mandating that the data controller and processor shall ‘implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security’ (GDPR, 2018) it raises the question what is an appropriate level of security? Although it is not explicitly called out in the case study, it can be assumed that the file they are referring to is a paper file. This immediately causes a problem as technical controls such as encryption cannot be enforced, access control measures cannot be used (Senor et al, 2012) and instead physical security measures must be relied upon.  With paper records there is no way of knowing whether a lost record has been breached or not, if the record was digital on a mobile device it could be protected by cryptography or be remote wiped before an attacker can gain access to the information (Le et al, 2018), unfortunately with paper records this is not possible.<p> 
									<p>If having paper records is the only way to conduct this evidence review, there also needs to be appropriate organisational measures (GDPR, 2018) such as an audit process to sign in and out the evidence materials therefore helping to pinpoint when exactly the information may have gone missing or who was responsible. Based on this I would agree with the commissioner that neither appropriate technical or organisational measures had been put in place to protect the sensitive information in the file.<p>

									<h3>Peer Response 2</h3>
									<p>Hi Abidemi, I found your post about the Adobe breach very interesting and specifically the part around when the breach should have been reported. Whilst GDPR states that an organisation must notify the ICO within 72 hours of becoming aware of a breach (GDPR, 2018) the point of when the breach is confirmed can sometimes be up for debate and therefore from what point does the 72 hours start.<p>
 									<p>The ICO describes a personal data breach as ‘breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, personal data’ (ICO) therefore until Adobe confirmed that the personal data had been accessed and stolen they could argue this was a security incident which was still in the incident response phase (Karya & Mitrou, 2016) therefore arguing that the 72 hours does not start until the loss of data is confirmed.<p>
