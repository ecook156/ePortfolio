									<h2>Discuss why Cyber Security is now a global issue and why it is important for companies to invest in Cyber Security.</h2>
									
									<p>The investment in Cyber Security is critical to organisations due to the growing number of successful attacks leading to data breaches (Vaidya 2019). My initial post focused on the need to invest in Cyber Security controls in order to reduce the financial impact from a GDPR fine or loss of custom from reputational damage as described by Meadows (2021). Peuhkurinen (2021) suggests that GDPR is not prescriptive enough, therefore it is difficult to know what controls to invest in to be deemed appropriate by the ICO. Without specific guidance from regulators, it is left up to the organisation to determine what level of controls they implement. Organisations must invest in their security analysts to allow accurate risk assessments and threat modelling of their systems to determine the impact of information being stolen and to invest where necessary.

British Airway’s lack of investment in secure software development and a suitable patching programme left their systems vulnerable for 6 years which was successfully exploited. This resulted in the ICO issuing a fine for “Insufficient technical and organizational measures to ensure information security” (ICO, 2020). It can be argued that not only were BA’s security controls insufficient for the customer data they processed but they were not following secure design principles. 

Subramaniam (2021) suggest that investment in monitoring and visibility is the most important factor for organisations. However, although investment in all layers of security is important, I believe organisations should invest in their preventative measures by integrating security into software development (Williams 2019), implementing firewalls, access controls and keeping systems patched to stop penetration to begin with and therefore reducing the investment needed for monitoring and detection. Investment in Cyber Security prevention should be an organisations priority in order to demonstrate they have taken appropriate steps which, if a breach still occurred, could reduce a fine imposed to them by the ICO as was the case for The Marriott (Peuhkurinen, 2021).
