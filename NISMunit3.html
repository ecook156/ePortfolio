									<h2>Collaborative Learning Discussion 1</h2>
									<p>For the final part of this discussion we were summarise the discussions had over the past 3 units to conclude a repsonse to the artile by Glisson et al (2015) on Compromising a Medical Mannequin<p>
									
									<h3>Summary Post</h3>
									
									<p>The Internet of Things (IoT) devices are increasing rapidly and have become an integral part of the healthcare industry (Mavrogiorgou 2019), while this provides advancements in the accuracy and reliability of medical devices (Maktoubian & Ansari, 2019) it comes with new security risks that need to be addressed. Ramezani et al (2016) found an average hospital used over 10,000 different types of devices and, if replaced by IoT technologies, the potential number of vulnerabilities that could be introduced would be unmanageable. Therefore the need for secure solutions for IoT devices is a challenge that should be focused on, especially in a medical setting (Necat, 2022).<p> 
									<p>One example of this is the iStan devices discussed in Compromising a Medical Mannequin (Glisson et al, 2015). Following the collaborative discussion, the threats of denial of service and brute force attack were identified based on vulnerabilities to the training devices. There were many mitigating controls suggested such as upgrading the firmware on the access point and disabling WPS (Adelakun, 2022), improving network security by using firewalls to hinder DoS attacks (Ahmad, 2022) and mitigation against brute force attacks through authentication controls by increasing the complexity of passwords, lock out after a number of failed attempts and multi factor authentication (Tolofari, 2022).<p>
									<p>Whilst the likelihood of a malicious actor targeting a training facility could be low, the ease of which students were able to use open-source tools with no previously taught penetration testing skills (Glisson et al, 2015) to exploit these vulnerabilities increases the reproducibility of these attacks occurring. Due to the nature of the devices being used for training of medical professionals, the damage that could be done to patients, from incorrect training, makes the impact severe and likely to affect a large amount of patients. Therefore, following a DREAD analysis (Mackman et al, 2003), it can be argued the risk of an attack on the iStan devices is high and should therefore be treated accordingly.<p>
