                  <h2>Literature Review Evaluation & Reflection</h2>
                  
                  <h3>Description</h3>
									
									<p>For the unit 7 summative literature review, I chose to cover the topic of ‘What is the Gender Pay Gap in the UK Technology sector.’ I chose this topic as a female working and studying in this field it interested me to find out if there was a gap and what the cause could be. There was a lot of literature available to research as well as publicly available quantifiable data around the topic that could also be used for the review which provided a different type of data to review as well as the academic literature. The process of reviewing literature and writing the essay was quite straight forward once a focus for the discussion was chosen. Feedback for the assignment was average with a mix of positive and negative points for improvement and the overall grade reflected the comments made. <p>
                  
                  <h3>Feelings</h3>
                  
                  <p>I felt that by choosing a topic I was passionate about I would be more motivated and interested to complete the vast amounts of research required and therefore more likely to perform better. This worked well for me as I thoroughly enjoyed the process of completing this literature review as I felt more engaged in the topic and was excited to learn more. At the time of submission, I felt happy with the work I had produced as I felt I couldn’t not have tried any harder nor did I feel I would have made any changes. However, upon receiving the feedback, I was initially disappointed with the final grade as I had previously felt so confident with the assignment, though on reflection I can see the areas that could have been better to improve the overall score. <p>
                  
                  <h3>Evaluation</h3>
                  <p>The overall structure and presentation of the review was excellent, which is an area that is quite simple to get right with the proper planning therefore I was pleased to have a positive outcome in this section. Whilst there was very good knowledge shown throughout the discussion, it was noted that the review took a while to get into the critical discussion as there was a lot of description at the beginning of the review. This had been noted throughout the writing of the review as the word count had been met very quickly, time had to then be taken to cut back in certain areas and on reflection this should have been done more on the first half of the review.<p>
                  <p>The feedback around criticality was good however it was noted that the arguments tended to be one sided and the imbalances could have been further reviewed. There were topics covered that could have been discussed in more detail that could have led to more critical analysis. Another area of weakness in this assignment was the academic integrity, although a good range of sources and literature were used, this was weakened by some of text not being re written into own words.<p>
                  
                  <h3>Analysis</h3>
                  <p>Although I had a personal interest and investment this chosen topic, I tried to make a conscious effort not to make assumptions around whether there was a pay gap or not, however based on the feedback on this assignment I could have researched further into counter arguments in order to strengthen the criticality of the assignment, clearly some unconscious bias towards the subject crept through as a result of it being a subject I had passion about. <p>
                  <p>Whilst the feedback for criticality of the report was still ‘very good’ this was clearly an area that needed to be strengthened and due to the high weighting of this section in the marking criteria, and this had an impact on the overall score. This is an area of weakness in previous assignments and one that still has planet of room for improvement and should be worked on. It was praised that there was a good range of academic sources which meant there was evidence and literature to back up most statements made, however, not rewriting them enough into my own words is a simple task that could have been avoided which may have significantly improved the overall grade.<p>
                  
                  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                  <p>Overall, the planning and approach for the assignment was good which resulted in a specific area of research which was of interest and provided opportunities for deep research and literature review and the review was structured accordingly. However, there should have been more focus on the critical analysis and less on the knowledge and description to make better use of the word count. <p>
                  
                  <h3>Action Plan</h3>
                  <p>• Continue to have a structured and well-presented format to assignments<p>
                  <p>•	Continue to use a wide range of sources and literature in reviews which a focus on newer and relevant sources<p>
                  <p>•	Plan at the start of an assignment how word count can divided between sections to focus less on knowledge and description and more on critical discussion<p>
                  <p>•	Complete an integrity review through Turnitin prior to assignment submission<p>
