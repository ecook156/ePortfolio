										<h1>Unit 10 - Analysing and Mitigating Security Breaches</h1>

									<h2>Collaborative Discussion 3</h2>
									<p>In this unit we were to provide a summary of the discussion based on our initial post and the feedback from your peers.<p> 
                							
									<h3>Summary Post</h3>
									<p>My first post discussed the case of disclosure of sensitive data by a hospital to a third party and that this could have been mitigated through appropriate organisational and technical measures (GDPR, 2018) including the introduction of better policies and procedures as well as automation and technical solutions to reduce the risk of human error which caused the breach.<p>
 									<p>Whilst Peuhkurinen (2022) argued that the implementation of my suggested secure mail service adds additional complexities with regards to data retention or erasure requests and not keeping data longer than is necessary or required (GDPR, 2018) it can be argued that the benefits of this solution make identification of records that need to be deleted easier than that of paper records and therefore helps to further ensure compliance with GDPR. However, Jubet (2022) also argues the point in favour of paper records in that destruction of paper will make the record impossible to recover but with electronic data can potentially be retrived if it has not been over written (Tabona, 2019).<p> 
 									<p>Based on this discussion it is clear that an organisation dealing with paper records needs to make a risk based decision on whether they can maintain more compliance operating a digital solution over traditional paper records with either approach proving to be risk free. However, regardless of the approach of how the data will be handled, whether paper or digital, there must be appropriate employee training in place to educate staff on the importance of GDPR (Sodaba, 2022) and how to handle the data appropriately. This helps to reduce potential risks caused by human error which Evans et al (2016) found to be the cause of half of the security breaches they researched.<p>
