                  <h2>Research Proposal Outline</h2>
									
									<h3>Project Title</h3>
									
									<p>The use of Artificial Intelligence for phishing prevention<p>
									
                  <h3>Significance/Contribution to the discipline/Research Problem</h3>
                  
									<p>CYBOK Adversarial Behaviours and Malware and Attack Technologies areas of research<p>
                  <p>Phishing is a significant method of attack that is mostly prevented through standard technologies such as email filtering and malware detection however more sophisticated phishing emails can bypass these measures and therefore rely on the human to identify the malicious email and avoid taking action.<p>
                  <p>However, as humans are a weak point when it comes to organisation security, other technologies could be used to reduce the need for human interaction.<p>
                  <p>The increase in artificial intelligence has made is possible to respond to more sophisticated phishing attacks based on how a human would interact with the email.<p>
                  <p>If this was effective, it could be rolled out to organisation as a security control that would reduce the number of successful phishing attacks.<p>
									
									<h3>Research Question</h3>
									<p>Can Artificial Intelligence be used to prevent phishing attacks on organisations?<p>
                  
									<h3>Aims and Objectives</h3>
									<p>To research the limitations of standard phishing prevention methods<p>
                  <p>Understand the issues caused by reliance on human as a prevention method<p>
                  <p>To understand the benefits of using artificial intelligence to detect phishing emails and whether this would prevent successful attacks on organisations<p>
                  <p>Research how these technologies can be integrated into<p>

                    
									<h3>Methodology/Development strategy/Research Design</h3>
									<p>1.	Primary research – surveys of security and IT professionals to collate closed question responses that can be captured as quantitative data<p>
                  <p>2.	Primary research – interviews of security and IT professionals to gather qualitative data to gain further insight based on results from the survey<p>
                  <p>3.	Secondary research – look at historical phishing attacks that have taken place on organisations and the root cause of these (was it lack of technical prevention or human error)<p>

									<h3>Ethical considerations and risk assessment (as part of your ethical approval application).</h3>
									<p>Ensure consent from all participants used for the survey and interviews and that they understand how data collected will be used<p>
                  <p>Ensure questions are not leading and that the research gathered is portrayed accurately regardless of the outcome of the research.<p>

									
									<h3>Description of artefact(s) that will be created (if applicable).</h3>
									<p>Statistical data based on the survey results<p>
                  <p>Statistical data based on interviews<p>
                  <p>Unified Modelling Language (UML) diagrams to represent the artificial intelligence technologies and how it can prevent phishing – these will include: use case, misuse case, sequence diagram and activity diagrams.<p>
