										<h1>Seminar 4: Security Standards</h1>
									</header>

									<h2>Preparation</h2>
									<p>For this seminar we were to review security standards and exmplain which of these were applicable to our assigned website and how they can be applied to the site and ensure complaince with the relevant standards. We discussed the questions as a group and prepared responses using a shared google document.<p>
									
									<h2>Which of the standards discussed in the sources above would apply to the website/ organisation assigned to you for the assessment?</h2>		
									<p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is applicable due to the site providing services to anyone living in europe.<p>
                  <p>PCI DSS is not applicable as there is no payment or ecommerce done through the site.<p>
                  <p>HIPAA is not applicable as there is no personal health information stored required.<p>
                    
									<h2>Evaluate your assigned website against the appropriate standards and decide how you would check if standards were being met?</h2>
                  <p>We based our review around the 7 principles of GDPR and assessed our website against each of the principles<p>
