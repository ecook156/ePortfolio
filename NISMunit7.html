										<h1>Unit 7 - Kali Linux Review</h1>
									</header>

									<h2>Task</h2>
									<p>For this activity we were required to read;<p> 
									<p>Leroux, S. (2020) The Kali Linux Review You Must Read Before You Start Using It. It's FOSS. Available from: https://itsfoss.com/kali-linux-review/<p>
									<p>Bhatt, D. (2018) Modern Day Penetration Testing Distribution Open Source Platform - Kali Linux - Study Paper. International Journal of Scientific & Technology Research 7(4): 233-237.<p> 
                							<p>Bhingardeve, N. & Franklin, S. (2018) A Comparison Study of Open Source Penetration Testing Tools. International Journal of Trend in Scientific Research and Development 2(4): 2595-2597.<p>
									<p>We then had to discuss our findings and experience using Kali Linux<p>
							
									<h3>What does the article teach you about carrying out vulnerability scans using Kali?</h3>
									<p>It is not the easiest tool to use but is highly adaptable – over 600 security testing tools and graphical interfaces to make it easier for beginners<p>
									<p>Can be used for information gathering, vulnerability analysis, Web app analysis, database assessment, password attacks, wireless attacks, reverse engineering and exploitation tools.<p>
									<p>If it’s the only tool you had you could still achieve a lot.<p>
					
									<h3>What issues might you encounter?</h3>
									<p>The main issue I encountered was installing Kali Linux onto my macbook pro<p>

									<h3>How would you overcome them?</h3>
									<p>I had to first install a virtual box suitable and then download the latest version of Kali from their website. I followed online instructions on how to do this and managed to complete it.<p>

									<h3>How do Bhingardeve & Franklin's results compare with your initial evaluation? and What do you think of their criteria?</h3>
									<p>The criteria that Bhingardeve & Franklin have used shows a good detailed breakdown of the important factors when testing a tool. Specifically, the criteria of ‘portability’ is not an area I previously considered when evaluating tools however for an ethical hacker or penetration tester, having a tool that only requires access to a laptop for example is going to make performing tests much more accessible. Especially if the tester acts in a consultation capacity and goes to different organisations.<p>
									<p>The use of ‘well documented’ and ‘supported’ are very valuable criteria to assess a tool on based on a user, especially a beginner, being able to help them self via documentation and also being able to receive regular updates. This will ensure the tools always maintain their security and ability to adapt and update to introduce new features.<p>
									<p>Whilst the criteria used was more detailed than we discussed during our group activity, the choice to mark ‘yes’ or leave blank against each tool doesn’t allow a reader to compare the tools as easily. While ‘yes’ or blank works for the criteria such as ‘free’ which can only be a yes or no answer,  other criteria such as ‘powerful’ would have benefited from having a score out of 5. For example John the Ripper and SQLmap were left blank, but one of them may be more powerful than the other, same for the tools that were marked ‘yes’. Using a score of 1-5 would give readers a more information to compare the different tools based on their needs.<p>
									<h3>“Kali Linux is a well-respected collection of open source pen testing tools, including metasploit, nmap, wireshark and sqlmap amongst many others. It has the benefit of being available as a ‘live distro’ which means that there is no requirement to install it – it will run from a DVD or a USB/ thumb drive. For these reasons, we recommend that Kali Linux is the tool of choice for this assignment.” (UoEO Computing Team, 2020.) Based on your evaluation in the previous session and the articles above, consider the recommendation given above:</h3>
									<h3>What are the pros and cons of using Kali Linux vs. Nessus? and has this changed your original evaluation score?</h3>
									<p>Our initial group review of open source pen testing tools during unit 6 scored Nessus as one of the highest tools in terms of ease of use, flexibility, reputation, licensing and ease to install with an average score of 4.4 out of 5.<p>
									<p>As a group we felt this was one of the easiest tools for a beginner to use.<p>
									<p>Against the same criteria we scored Kali Linux as a 3.2. This was mostly influenced by the ease of use and ease to install scoring very low. Although once you have Kalis Linux installed there are a range of tools available which offers high flexibility, it can be difficult to set up and install at the start.<p>
