									<h2>Collaborative Learning Discussion 1</h2>
									<p>For this discussion we were required to pick a case study from the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) and review the application of ethics<p>
									
									<h3>Initial Post</h3>
                  
                  <p>Case study: Abusive workplace behaviour<p>
									
									<p>The ACM code of ethics is designed to be followed by computing professionals to ensure they act responsibly and support the public good (ACM, 2018). In the case study of abusive workplace behaviour, it accurately describes how the actions of Max towards Diane throughout their work together resulted in verbal abuse which failed to keep a safe environment, there was failure to adhere to high standards of professional communication and abuse of power specifically directed at females all of which are issues that these codes have attempted to address for several years (Anderson, 1992).<p>
 									<p>Whilst abuse of power and history of targeting females goes against principle 1.4 of the ACM code of ethics, there could also be a case for discrimination at work under the equality act 2010 which protects individuals against victimisation based on a characteristic (Government equalities office, 2015).<p>	
                  <p>With regards to the BCS code of conduct (BCS, 2022), Max did not perform in line with the British Computer Society code expected of a computing professional. There was a clear disregard to the Public Interest principle of conducting professional activities without discrimination in the way he stopped Diane from being recognised for her work. He did not seek to avoid situations that may give rise to conflict (Duty to relevant authority principle) and it could be argued that the actions he took actively sought out conflict due to his attitude towards other members of the team. By not recognising others work and the team through mistakes Max also went against principle of Duty to the Profession by not supporting his fellow members through their professional development.<p>
                  <p>The case study shows how both the ACM code of ethics and BCS code of conduct were not followed by the professionals but included potential legal issues of gender discrimination, which would have larger consequences than those of the computing codes of ethics.<p>
