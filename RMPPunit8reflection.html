                  <h2>End of Unit 8 Reflection</h2>
									
									<p>During the start of this unit, I focused on the research proposal topic and outline as this was something I wanted to receive feedback on prior to settling on my discussion topic. There was a lot of activity to complete in this week with the collaborative discussion responses around research ethics, a new topic for the unit 10 summative and the start of the statistical inference topic and worksheets. <p>
                  <p>Based on the combination of covering a mix of topics in this unit I found this to be quite an overwhelming unit and the approach I took was to focus on one task at a time and completing that first before moving on to the next. This allowed me to separate the thinking between the various areas of work and ensure I had completed each activity before giving thought to the next.<p>
