									<h3>Meeting notes</h3>

                  <p>Items discussed:<p>
                  <h3>Assignment</h3>
                  <p>We have made good progress on the final assignment so far - word count is up to over 1600, there is still more to add and then final edits<p>
                  <p>Samuel will review references and keep them in order as we go - we need to make sure they are up to date and include URLs as feedback from the last assignment was around our references not being accurate<p> 
                  <p>The conclusion will be completed once the rest of the report is nearly finished<p>
                  <p>We need to add mitigations and recommendations for each of the vulnerabilities discussed<p>
                  <p>When discussing the order of the recommendations by business priority Samuel suggested we order them according to OWASP - this was a great suggestion and we all agreed<p>
                  <p>Beth will add more to the outdated components section about general Apache vulnerabilities<p>
                  <p>We will add a few sentences to explain why we have only explored the top vulnerabilities<p>
                  <p>GDPR needs to be included throughout the report as that is the standard the website needs to comply with<p>

                  <h3>Seminar Preparation</h3>

                  <p>Isioma has shared a seminar document to help us prepare<p>
                  <p>We will all review the debate and prepare some arguments for next Sunday to discuss ahead of the following seminar<p>

                  <p>We agreed to reconvene next week Sunday by 1800hrs to discuss the above<p>
