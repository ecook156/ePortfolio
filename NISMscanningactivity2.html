										<h1>Scanning Activity 2</h1>
									</header>

									<h2>Task</h2>
									<p>For this scanning acitivy we had to perform scans of our assigned website (allmytype.co.uk) using tools available through Kali Linux to answer as many of the following questions as we could:<p>
									<p>What Operating System does the web site utilise?<p>
               							   	<p>What web server software is it running?<p>
                  							<p>Is it running a CMS (Wordpress, Drupal, etc?)<p>
                  							<p>What protection does it have (CDN, Proxy, Firewall?)<p>
                  							<p>Where is it hosted?<p>
                 					 		<p>Does it have any open ports?<p>
                  							<p>Does the site have any known vulnerabilities?<p>
                  							<p>What versions of software is it using? Are these patched so that they are up to date?<p>
									
									<h2>Approach</h2>
									
									<p>For this exercise we decided as a group to each have a go at the scanning acitivy and then discuss and agree the results in our following meeting, this was the same approach we had taken previously and it worked to ensure each member had a go at the activity.<p>
