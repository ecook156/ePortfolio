                  <h2>End of Unit 10 Reflection</h2>
									
									<p>This unit focused on research writing which was relevant to both the unit 10 summative assignment and what will become the capstone project. I tried to apply some of the knowledge around both written and oral skills to both the transcript and presentation completed this week. The key learning takeaway this week was around making sure the work carried out was logical and structured in a way that made sense. Upon completing some of the reading for this unit I was then able to review my research proposal presentation to ensure it followed a similar logical structure, The University of Essex (2012) 8 step guide to writing a research proposal was extremely helpful in breaking down the steps to make it less overwhelming. <p>
                  <p>I had already completed most of the research and brainstorming for the research proposal so this week I focused on writing this up into the local arguments and creating the presentation and audit once I has happy with the transcript. <p>
