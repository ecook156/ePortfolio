									<h2>Collaborative Learning Discussion 2</h2>
									<p>For this discussion we had ro review the case study around accuracy of information<p>
									
									<h3>Initial Post</h3>
        			
									<p>As a statistical programmer it is important to present data as honestly as possible to allow the audience to make their own interpretation of it (Gelman, 2018). Abi must ensure the validity of his data by presenting what has been found as accurately as possible. Research bias may occur during the analysis of the data (Pannucci & Wilkins, 2010) if Abi tries to take Whizzzâ€™ response to the data into consideration resulting in research bias which is unethical (Simundic, 2013). It is however acceptable for Abi to interpret the data to use the correlations he found to present the positive findings of his research.<p>
                  <p>Computing professionals should not misrepresent or withhold information on the performance of products, systems or services (BCS, 2022) therefore Abi must present the results for both positive and negative sides of the argument to Whizzz in order to act ethically. By providing Whizzz with all of the research, they will be legally obligated to ensure they are not false advertising the nutrient value of their product (Rhodes & Wilson, 2018). However, if they did not have all of the information from Abi, they could have done by accident. If this later came out that Abi had withheld the information, he could be liable for any false claims made by Whizzz.<p>
                  <p>Abi is responsible for ensuring his program offers accurate results, however if a user of it chooses to use the results for a different purpose, he should not be held responsible. When it comes to statistical programming it can also be important to ensure the users of the program have access to the data analysis scripts to ensure they are accurate (Herndon et al, 2014). This ensures Abi cannot be blamed for the outcome of any data analysis if there was an error in his program as the user had access to check the script.<p>
                  <p>Abi should provide both sets of data to the manufacturer for them to have the whole picture, if they choose to only use the positive results that is their call. However, Abi must make sure they do not manipulate any of his data prior to publication and if this was the case, he would need to take action to address it to prevent his research from being slandered.<p>
