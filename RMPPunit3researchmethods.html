									<h2>Research Methods for Capstone Project and Literature Review</h2>
					
									<p>Deductive reasoning is likely to be used throughout the project as it is a method that takes prior knowledge of a subject (Dawson, 2015). Given the subject chosen is one I will be interested in it is understandable that I will have some initial thoughts about the topic.<p>
                  <p>Exploratory studies are likely to be used when a subject has been chosen as it allows for studying of a situation too find new insights and ask questions (Robson, 2002).  This will add to the project by using literature reviews as well as primary research methods to gather the information needed about the project. However, depending on the subject chosen and research found throughout the process it may be that a conclusion can be drawn at the end.<p>
                  
									<h3>Quantitative v Qualitative Research Methods </h3>

									<p>For my literature review I intend to use quantitative data taken from organisations public reports, although this will be second hand it will be numerical and make for simpler comparative analysis. For the literature review qualitative data will come from academic literature through quotes and paraphrasing.<p>
                  <p>For my project I will utilise surveys for mass collection of qualitative data in a standardized format (Saunders et al, 2012) as I have access to security professionals and experts in the field of study. I will also utilise interviews for more in depth thoughts around the topic. Whilst structured interviews will allow me to stick to the topic and keep the conversation on track, it may be that unstructured questions allow for more opinion and expansion into areas that are relevant, but I may not have thought to ask about. Either way it is vital that the interviews are prepared in advance and recorded for accurate note taking.<p>
