									<h2>Reflection on group work for assignment 1 - Design Document</h2>
                  
            
									<h3>Description</h3>
                  <p>For the first assignment we had to create a design document based on our assigned website (allmytype.co.uk) to present to the organisation explaining what security standards and frameworks the site must adhere to, any potential vulnerabilities that could exist and how these could be mitigated against. There was a 1000 word count for the document and this would include tables, graphs and charts to present the work.<p>
                  <h3>Feelings</h3>
                  <p>Whilst my previous reflection discussed how my concerns of group work were outweighed by the benefits of being able to utilise many minds and different thinkers to help with discussions, I was still apprehensive at the thought of producing a report as a group. Firstly, I was unsure how the logistics would work by trying to all write one document together at the same time with potentially different ideas. Secondly, the 1000 word limit meant each of us only had the opportunity to input 250 words to the assignment which doesn't give much scope for showcasing our skills and finally I also thought producing a cohesive report written in the same style that flowed together as one design document would be a challenge.<p>
                  <h3>Evaluation</h3>
                  <p>We approached the assignment by creating a draft document in google docs and agreed we would all use that to collate our ideas and that would eventually become our final document. This meant we could all work on a live document at the same time and see who else was making changes and contributing, this solved the logistics problem. I started the document by pulling out all of the requirements from the marking criteria and splitting them in potential sections e.g introduction, security standards and vulnerabilities. As we were having regular meetings we were able to discuss our approach and how we would structure the report which meant each person could focus on writing the bulk of a section and then we could all go in and make edits and suggestions on each other's work. Utilising the comments section in google docs meant we could ask questions or make comments ready for when the person checked back in, which was useful when we were all working different hours and in different time zones. I focused on writing the introduction and GDPR sections and then contributed to some of the vulnerabilities. Once the bulk of the work was written we then edited the document to ensure the language flowed throughout. We did find the word count difficult to stick to therefore when large sections needed to be removed, we discussed this as a group in the meetings so as not to remove anyone's work without agreeing to it beforehand.<p>
                  <h3>Analysis</h3>
                  <p>My previous reflection discussed how having ideas from multiple people helped with adding to my knowledge or ensuring the report included ideas I may not have thought of, however, with a written report I do think it is more difficult to achieve as a group. Whilst overcoming the logistics and the structure and content of the report was relatively straight forward, more time has to be spent on ensuring the report sounds like it is written as one which is time that is not required for individual assignments, I did find some duplication of points which used up unnecessary word count and had to be removed. This extra work was somewhat outweighed by how quickly we were able to come together and write the report as 250 words each does not take much time.<p>
                  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                  <p>In conclusion, there are definitely pros and cons of group assignment writing and we found the success to achieving a cohesive report was having a clear structure and plan from the start so that we could minimise cross over of work and each focus on a certain section, this also meant everyone was contributing equally which was just as important. <p>
                  <h3>Action Plan</h3>
                  <p>1. Ensure future assignments are planned out in advance before diving straight into the writing of the report, thus ensuring structure and focus to the report so all group members have a clear view of the aim.<p>
                  <p>2. Allow enough time before the assignment deadline to edit the assignment and writing style to ensure the report reads as if written by an individual.<p>
                  <p>3. Continue to work collaboratively through google docs as this allows everyone to contribute in real time and avoids the need to constantly save and share documents.<p>
