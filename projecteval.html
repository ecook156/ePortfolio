									<h2>Task</h2>
                  <p>Evaluation of the executive summary compared to the design document and how we approached the second assignment<p>
                 
		<h3>Evaluation</h3>
		<p>I was very pleased with how our group worked together to complete the final report based on the design document, we created a structure and plan to work off so we new that we were inlcuding all of the relevant criteria. Having already completed the design document, it was easier to start work on the executive summary as we used the table of vulerabilities as a plan.<p>
		<p>One of the key factors for us was making sure we listened to the feedback from our unit 6 assingment and incorated that into our final assignment in order to do this we needed to make sure we were being critical and analytical rather than just descriptive. In order to achieve this we made a decision as a group not to include all 12 vulnerabilties that we had previously discussed in the design document. Instead we chose to focus the executive summary on the ones that we could evdience through the scanning we had done and therefor proivde more realistic comments, mitigations and recomendations. We agreed that with the limited word count if we tried to cover all vulnerabilties we would not be able to delve deeper into the analysis and recomendations, which was a key aspect of this report.<p>
		<p>Another focus was making sure we incorporated complaince with GDPR throughout the executive report and how each vulnerabitoy could impact complaince with the regulation, I feel we acheived this which ensured the report was more cohesive as a whole and less divided into sections which our design document was.<p>
		<p>The other area I was keen to improve on from the design document was to esnure we included a conclusion to complete the report, we hadnt included this with the design document due to word count, but it was highlighted in the feedback. We used the conlcudion to make the reccomendations and bring the report to a close tying in all of the vulnerabilties found, the ones we didnt discuss and how complaint we felt the organisation was with GDPR.<p>
