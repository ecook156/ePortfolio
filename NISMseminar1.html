										<h1>Seminar 1: STRIDE and DREAD tools</h1>
									</header>

									<h2>Preparation</h2>
									<p>For this seminar we were to use Microsofts STRIDE and DREAD tools to perform a risk assessment based on our disccuion 1 around Glisson et al (2015) Compromising a Medical Mannequin and discuss what the highest risks were and what assumptions had been made. We prepared 2 slides to cover a risk assessment using DREAD as an analysis tool.<p>
									
									<h3>Identified Threats</h3>
									
									<p>Using the STRIDE threat model we have identified 2 main threats to the iStan devices<p>
									<p>1. Threat of denial of service on the iStan devices<p>
									<p>As proven by the case study and discussion posts it is possible to cause a denial of service attack on the network making the iStan devices and software unavailable.<p>
									<p>2. Threat of tampering with the devices following a brute force attack<p>
									<p>Due to the ability to brute force attack the PIN on the network router this could allow a malicious actor to tamper with the iStan devices and any connected information.<p>
							
									<h3>Threat of Denial of Service</h3>
									
									<p> Damage - Would stop the use of the devices while under attack = 2<p>

									<p> Reproducibility - Easy to launch the attack using open source tools = 3<p>

									<p> Exploitability - Little to no pen test and computer science skills required to create the attack = 2<p>

									<p> Affected Users - Will only affect devices in the specific location = 1<p>
										
									<p> Discoverability - Easy to discover the vulnerability as was done in the case study = 2<p>
									
									<h3>Total risk score = 10</h3>

									<h3>Threat of Tampering</h3>
									
									<p> Damage - Would affect the training of medical professionals = 3<p>

									<p> Reproducibility - Easy to launch the attack using open source tools = 3<p>

									<p> Exploitability - Must be in within a certain distance to the devices = 1<p>

									<p> Affected Users - Could impact many patients by medical professionals with insufficient training = 3<p>
										
									<p> Discoverability - Easy to discover the vulnerability as was done in the case study = 2<p>
									
									<h3>Total risk score = 12</h3>
