										<h1>Unit 9 - Analysing Qualitative Data</h1>

									<h2>Collaborative Learning Discussion 2</h2>
									
									<h3>Summary Post</h3>
									
									<p>The initial post discussed the importance of Abi ensuring the validity of his data by presenting this accurately to Whizzz. This would mean he was acting in accordance with the ethical standards in which a computing professional should meet by not withholding information (BCS, 2022).<p>
                  <p>When analysis of the data is complete, research bias may be hard to avoid (Pannucci & Wilkins, 2010) as Abi has been employed for specific research where Whizzz want to obtain a positive outcome. However, Manaog (2023) argues that this type of bias could conceal the accurate findings and that interpreting the data to give an overall positive outcome introduced these biases further (Chartres et al, 2019). In order to address this and remove as much bias as possible, Abi could introduce a peer review into his research and analysis by someone who has not been given the background as to Whizzz aims of demonstrating nutritional value of their product. Without this information, an independent peer reviewer could assess the results and see if they come to the same conclusion.<p>
                  <p>By removing bias and providing full and accurate results to Whizzz, Abi should be protected from any legal implications if Whizzz choose to mislead their consumers through marketing (Advertising Standards Agency, 2023). However, if it could be proven that Abi had withheld information, he should be held accountable. Whist it can be argued that there could be a requirement for a research ethics counsel (Berisford-Maynard, 2023) the requirement for computing professionals to be honest and trustworthy and provide appropriate professional review is covered by the ACM code of ethics (2018). Although ethics boards provide a set of principles for professionals to work by, they are not legally enforceable and would likely not deter someone from providing false research if they wanted to. <p>
