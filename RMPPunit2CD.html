									<h2>Collaborative Learning Discussion 1</h2>
									<p>For this discussion we were required to pick a case study from the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) and review the application of ethics<p>
									
									<h3>Peer Responses</h3>
                  
                  <h3>Peer Response 1 to Demian Berisford-Maynard's Initial Post</h3>
									
									<p>I agree that when it comes to the law, this should override any other requirements for state sponsored black hat penetration testing and in the UK the Computer Misuse Act (1990) clearly states that unauthorised access to computer material is illegal which includes hacking and would be classed as a criminal offence. <p>
                  <p>Whilst you have said there are positives to be taken from Blackhat testing against terrorist organisations (Horseley, 2018) I feel this has both ethical and legal implications. Due to the way in which evidence would be obtained of terrorist behaviour, if unauthorised access to criminals’ computers is used, this evidence can become inadmissible in court. The UK Human rights Act (1998) ensures individuals can defend their rights to privacy which protects against unnecessary intrusion or surveillance into a person’s life (Liberty, n.d) meaning any hacking on a terrorist’s device would result in a breach of their human rights and mean evidence was illegally obtained.<p>
                  <p>On the ethics of this type of work the British Computer Society also state that IT professionals must have regard for public health and privacy under the Public Interest principle and as previously stated, black hat type hacking could impact privacy of an individual.<p>

                  <h3>Peer Response 2 to Djordje Savanovic's Initial Post</h3>
                  
                  <p>You make some very interesting points around the ethics involved with AI weapon systems and the fact that both the BCS code of conduct (2022) and ACM Code of ethics (2018) clearly state that IT professionals should be concerned with public safety. However, whilst these are codes that IT professionals should follows, they are not legally binding or would likely result in any criminal case if not followed. <p>
                  <p>You also stated that potential for human life loss from this type of weaponry must be weighed against the technological benefits (Savanovic, 2023) however it should also be considered that the loss of human life that these AI weapons may result in, should be compared with the number of lives that could be saved. For example if the machinery was used to take out a terrorist, it could take one life but could save 100s, in this case the ethics of public safety should apply to the 100s of lives being saved through the AI system and therefore to not use this type of technology could be against the codes.<p>
