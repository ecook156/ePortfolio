										<h1>Assignment 2 - Executive Summary</h1>
									</header>

									<h2>Task</h2>
                  <p>For the second assignment we had to produce an executive summary of the completed evaluation based on the previous design document. We had to select a number of vulnerability scanning tools (as reviewed during the module) and use them to test for and detect the (potential) vulnerabilities listed in the deisng document.<p>
                  <p>The executive summary had to pull together findings, recommendations, and conclusions in a clear and unambiguous format consisting of:<p>
                  <p>A brief summary of the work carried out, tools used and justificationsfor their use.<p>
                  <p>Summary of findings presented in an easy-to-understand format.<p>
                  <p>A discussion of any vulnerabilities discovered and explanations of why expected vulnerabilities were not detected.<p>
                  <p>Conclusions and recommendations - i.e. how the site owner could improve the site security â€“ with justifications.<p>
                  
                  <h3>Contributions</h3>
                  <p>All members of the team contributed equally to the success of the report, we each wrote sections to begin with and then reviewed and made edits to the rest of the groups work<p>
                  
                  <h3>My individual contributions</h3>
                  <p>I set up the intial draft document in google docs with a suggested structure for the report based on the tasks and grading criteria. I then started with the introduction of what the report would cover and the purpose.<p>
                  <p>I began the work on why we selected some of the tools we did and included acedemic research for Kali Linux, incluing Nikto and Nmap.<p>
                  <p>Everyone contributed to the different vulnerabilties and my focus was on Vulnerable and Outdated componants based on the scans I had done in previous units.<p>
                  <p>I then finalised the report by drafting the conclusion to include the recommendations the rest of the team had included throughout the report. Once others had reviewed I made a few changes to this to incorprate some of the feedback.<p>
                  <p>The final part of the assignment was completing a thourough review where I helped to reduce the word count and also ensure the report was written to the best of our ability.<p>
