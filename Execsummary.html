										<h1>Assignment 2 - Executive Summary</h1>
									</header>

									<h2>Task</h2>
                  <p>For the second assignment we had to produce an executive summary of the completed evaluation based on the previous design document. We had to select a number of vulnerability scanning tools (as reviewed during the module) and use them to test for and detect the (potential) vulnerabilities listed in the deisng document.<p>
                  <p>The executive summary had to pull together findings, recommendations, and conclusions in a clear and unambiguous format consisting of:<p>
                  <p>A brief summary of the work carried out, tools used and justificationsfor their use.<p>
                  <p>Summary of findings presented in an easy-to-understand format.<p>
                  <p>A discussion of any vulnerabilities discovered and explanations of why expected vulnerabilities were not detected.<p>
                  <p>Conclusions and recommendations - i.e. how the site owner could improve the site security â€“ with justifications.<p>
                  
                  <h3>Contributions</h3>
                  <p>All members of the team contributed equally to the success of the report, we each wrote sections to begin with and then reviewed and made edits to the rest of the groups work<p>
                  
                  <h3>My individual contributions</h3>
                  <p>I set up the intial draft document in google docs with a suggested structure for the report based on the tasks and grading criteria. I then started with the introduction of what the report would cover and the purpose.<p>
                  <p>I began the work on why we selected some of the tools we did and included acedemic research for Kali Linux, incluing Nikto and Nmap.<p>
                  <p>Everyone contributed to the different vulnerabilties and my focus was on Vulnerable and Outdated componants based on the scans I had done in previous units.<p>
                  <p>I then finalised the report by drafting the conclusion to include the recommendations the rest of the team had included throughout the report. Once others had reviewed I made a few changes to this to incorprate some of the feedback.<p>
                  <p>The final part of the assignment was completing a thourough review where I helped to reduce the word count and also ensure the report was written to the best of our ability.<p>
		
		<h3>Evaluation</h3>
		<p>I was very pleased with how our group worked together to complete the final report based on the design document, we created a structure and plan to work off so we new that we were inlcuding all of the relevant criteria. Having already completed the design document, it was easier to start work on the executive summary as we used the table of vulerabilities as a plan.<p>
		<p>One of the key factors for us was making sure we listened to the feedback from our unit 6 assingment and incorated that into our final assignment in order to do this we needed to make sure we were being critical and analytical rather than just descriptive. In order to achieve this we made a decision as a group not to include all 12 vulnerabilties that we had previously discussed in the design document. Instead we chose to focus the executive summary on the ones that we could evdience through the scanning we had done and therefor proivde more realistic comments, mitigations and recomendations. We agreed that with the limited word count if we tried to cover all vulnerabilties we would not be able to delve deeper into the analysis and recomendations, which was a key aspect of this report.<p>
		<p>Another focus was making sure we incorporated complaince with GDPR throughout the executive report and how each vulnerabitoy could impact complaince with the regulation, I feel we acheived this which ensured the report was more cohesive as a whole and less divided into sections which our design document was.<p>
		<p>The other area I was keen to imporve on from the design document was to esnure we included a conclusion to complete the report, we hadnt included this with the design document due to word count, but it was highlighted in the feedback. We used the conlcudion to make the reccomendations and bring the report to a close tying in all of the vulnerabilties found, the ones we didnt discuss and how complaint we felt the organisation was with GDPR.<p>
