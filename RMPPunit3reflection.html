                  <h2>End of Unit 3 Reflection</h2>
									
									<p>This unit was key to understanding different research methods that will be used for my final project. Although I was already aware of the difference between Quantitative and Qualitative methods, I was not aware of all of the methods available for conducting each of these types of research. I have also learned the difference between exploratory and conclusive research (Fleetwood, n.d) which has given me something to consider when choosing my final project about how this will affect the topic chosen and whether I intend to reach a decision at the end based on the research.<p>
                  <p>I continued to focus on research for my literature review and started to build a collection of information and sources that I will use which has provided a basis for the discussion points and some initial findings for further research.<p>
