										<h1>Assignment 1 - Design Document Feedback</h1>
									</header>

									<h2>Reviewing the feedback we recieved on the first assignment was a key part of making sure we could improve and integrate this into our second assignment, this was an important part of the development and learning process.</h2>
									
                  <h3>Knowledge and understanding of the topic/issues under consideration (25%)</h3>
                  <p>You have provided a good level of knowledge & understanding of the regulations that you have listed.  There is also some explanation of the relevance of these to your allocated website, however there was scope for a bit more analysis for this section. You have mentioned GDPR etc.<p>

                  <h3>Application of knowledge and understanding (25%)</h3>
                  <p>There is a good demonstration of the application of knowledge with a range of security vulnerabilities listed. The various threats have generally been related to the specific website.  You could have also incorporated/linked in section 5, the regulations that identify the need to address these vulnerabilities.<p>

                  <h3>Criticality (25%)</h3>
                  <p>Some good use of references in the first part of your submission, although these could have continued in your table in 5.1 to support the recommendations you have provided. You have ordered these by the level of potential risk to the organisation in a table format â€“ DREAD analysis. You could have provided a brief conclusion to finalise the report.<p>
                  
                  <h3>Structure and Presentation (25%)</h3>
                  <p>A well organised report with the sections clearly laid out. A good range of references were included although they were not all in the correct referencing format. Spelling and grammar are good throughout.<p>
                  
                  <h2>My Review</h2>
                  <p>Based on the feedback I was happy with how our group had performed in the first assignment and there were componants we could replicate for the second assignment and other areas we needed to put more focus on.<p>
                  <p>I feel overall we had a good descriptive knowledge in the design document and articulated well the different vulnerabilties and mitigations and how these could be incorprated, however we lacked in the criticality and analysis in some areas where we could have focused more on the impacts of GDPR and used acedemic research to strengthen our arguements. I feel we struggled with the word count limit and therfore focused more on describing rather than analysing which we know now to improve for next time. I was happy with the comments about presentation and structure and will therefore aim to replicate this for the second report.<p>
