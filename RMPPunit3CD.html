									<h2>Collaborative Learning Discussion 1</h2>
									<p>For this discussion we were required to pick a case study from the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) and review the application of ethics<p>
									
									<h3>summary Post</h3>
									
									<p>Throughout this collaborative discussion it has become evident that there are clear ethical codes of practice that IT professionals must follow as described by the British Computer Societyâ€™s code of conduct (2022) and the ACM code of ethics (2018). These codes cover a variety of circumstances in the workplace and are designed to be used to guide ethical decision making (Wheeler, 2003).<p>
                  <p>However, whilst these codes aim to provide assistance in making ethical decisions, they could be open to different interpretations deepening on the situation. Savanovic (2023) described the case of automated active response weaponry (ACM, n.d) where the ACM principle of acting in public interest could suggest AI weaponry should not be used in case of accidental public injury, however in contrast to this it can be argued that not using this weaponry could result in more public injury from enemies, therefore making this guide to ethical decision making unclear.<p>
                  <p>As well as the guidance being open to interpretation, they are not legally binding and could be strengthened by legislation. In the case of abusive workplace behaviour (ACM, n.d) though abuse of power is shown throughout, there is clear gender discrimination under the Equality Act (Government equalities act, 2015) which would carry more weight than the codes of ethics would. Manaog (2023) pointed out it was crucial to establish a safe environment for all genders in the computing profession and this case clearly showed a lack of consciousness for that.<p>
