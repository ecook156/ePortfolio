										<h1>Assignment 1 - Design Document</h1>

									<h2>Task</h2>
                  <p>For the first assingment we were assigned a website, which for Group 2 was allmytype.co.uk, we had to write and submit a design document to our client which covers the following requirements:<p>
                  <p>Identify the appropriate governing body and associated regulations that apply to your assigned site (consider who will use it, the kind of information it contains/ displays, the industry it belongs to and the functionality it offers).<p>
                  <p>Create a list of possible security vulnerabilities, as determined by the regulations identified above.<p>
                  <p>Create a summary list of recommendations and potential mitigations that could be used to ameliorate the risks you identified. Note that these are theoretical risks, there is no requirement to perform any scans or tests on the site at this time. These should be ordered by the level of potential risk to the organisation that could (or would) own the site.<p>
    									
                  <h3>Contributions</h3>
                  <p>All members of the team contributed equally to the success of the report, we each wrote sections to begin with and then reviewed and made edits to the rest of the groups work<p>
                  
                  <h3>My individual contributions</h3>
                  <p>I set up the intial draft document in google docs with a suggested structure for the report based on the taks and grading criteria. I then started with writing the introduction to the report stating what our intent and what we would cover<p>
                  <p>Due to my professional experience with GDPR I wrote a section outlining the importance of the standard and how it applied to our website and then added some suggestions to the vulnerabities table. I provided edits and comments to the sections the rest of the team wrote and also ensured we ran the report through turnitin to check for plagorism. As team leader I then made the final submission<p>
