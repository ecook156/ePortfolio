									<h2>Reflection on Scanning Activities and units 6, 7, 8 & 9</h2>
                  
            
									<h3>Description</h3>
                  <p>This module was heavily focused on the analysis and use of scanning tools and carrying out various types of vulnerability scanning and exploration on our assigned website. These activities and scanning activity were required throughout multiple units and contributed to the work required for part of our group assignment. Having only worked in security for 3 years and in a role focused on risk, assurance and compliance, I did not have any experience with any of the tools, nor had I completed any type of scanning before entering this module.<p>
                  <h3>Feelings</h3>
                  <p>Based on my lack of experience in this area I was extremely nervous about the level of work that would be required and that I may find it very challenging, may not pick it up quickly enough and then I wouldn't be able to contribute as much to the group activities. However, whilst apprehensive, I was very much excited to carry out this work and learn a completely new skill that would help me better understand the steps that penetration testers or attackers may go through to gather information about a website and therefore give me more knowledge in what must be put in place to achieve a secure website.<p>
                  <h3>Evaluation</h3>
                  <p>I managed to complete each scanning activity and evaluation exercise as required although it did take me longer than others in the group. The initial activity to research traceroute scans on the website was relatively straightforward as I could utilise the terminal already installed on my macbook pro and the research activities into different tools available helped me better understand the options available and discover tools, all of which I had never used or heard of before. My first main challenge was for the second scanning activity where we were to use Kali Linux. I had not used this before and first had to follow steps on how to install a virtual box and Kali onto my Mac, I then used guides on how to use a number of the Kali applications for our assigned website. For each of the scanning activities I carried out, we discussed the findings in our group and I managed to come up with the same results as the other, more experienced, members of the group therefore deeming my work a success.<p>
                  <h3>Analysis</h3>
                  <p>This module also incorporated learning about various regulations and security standards such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). Whilst I was beginner to vulnerability scanning, my current job role is focused on PCI and GDPR compliance therefore I was able to use the knowledge I already had in this area. The benefit of this was that I could spend more time each week on learning and improvement my scanning skills as I didn't have to dedicate as much to learning about these standards. This made my study time more manageable and allowed me to focus on the areas I needed to most.<p>
                  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                  <p>To conclude, I have thoroughly enjoyed learning the basic scanning skills and how to gather information on a website that could be used by an attacker to exploit vulnerabilities. This has given me an oversight into a side of security I have not experienced and the combination of this with security standards will help me in my career development to be a more well rounded security professional.<p>
                  <h3>Action Plan</h3>
                  <p>1. Continue to read about and practice the skills I have used where possible so as to further develop them through the use of Kali Linux.<p>
