                  							<h2>Literature Review Outline</h2>
									
									<h3>What is the focus and aim of your review? Who is your audience?</h3>
									
									<p>To identify if there is a gender pay gap in the technology sector and what the gap is<p>
									<p>Look at historical evidence and change over time of the gender pay gap and what has been done to improve this so far and what can still be done going forward to further close the gap (if there is one)<p>
									
                  							<h3>Why is there a need for your review? Why is it significant?</h3>
									<p>In 2022, Women in tech UK identified a gender pay gap of 16% in the tech sector, which is higher than the national average of 11.6% in other areas.<p>
									<p>It is important to highlight why this is the case in order to fix the issue and close the gap and this review will help to establish the reasons for the gap <p>
									
									<h3>What is the context of the topic or issue? What perspective do you take? What framework do you use to synthesise the literature?</h3>
									<p>The review will be predominantly based on evidence/data from UK tech organisations<p>
									<p>Academic literature and critical analysis will be used to suggest why this data shows what it does, the impacts that could exist that affect the gender pay gap and how the gap can be improved<p>
									
									<h3>How did you locate and select sources for inclusion in the review?</h3>
									<p>Academic literature<p>
									<p>Gender pay reports from large tech companies for quantitative data - Organisations in the UK with over 250 employees are required to report this annually and it is available publicly by on the gov.uk website <p>
									<p>Sources need to be relevant and recent however comparisons over the past decade can be made to show changes/improvement in this area<p>
									
									<h3>How is your review structured? – Essay outline</h3>
									<p>1.	Introduction to the review – gender pay gap, the technology sector and the UK market<p>
									<p>2.	What is meant by gender pay gap<p>
									<p>3.	Why this is significant in the technology sector <p>
									<p>4.	Quantitative data from top tech companies to evidence the gap<p>
									<p>5.	Potential issues with this data <p>
									<p>6.	Research into the men/women in higher positions in IT and whether the link to pay is due to role <p>
									<p>7.	Causes of the gender pay gap in IT (women not encourage to work in IT historically therefore not in as high positions, there not being as many women working in IT, women are less likely than men to push themselves for promotion jobs and are more susceptible to imposter syndrome which could lead to less women in higher positions)<p>
									<p>8.	Conclusion as to whether there is a gap and the main cause of it<p>
									
									<h3>What are the main findings in the literature on this topic? </h3>
									<p>There is still a significant gap between male and females in technology<p>
									
									<h3>What are the main strengths and limitations of this literature? </h3>
									<p>Public reports from companies may not want to show a gender pay gap and could be biased<p>
									<p>Only publicised reports can be assessed <p>
									<p>Publicly available information is limited - technology organisations have other departments such as HR/marketing which may distort the figures due to higher female workers in these areas so it is hard to analyse just the traditional technology functions <p>
									
									<h3>Are there any discrepancies in this literature</h3>
									<p>TBC<p>
									
									<h3>What conclusions do your draw from the review? What do you argue needs to be done as an outcome of the review?</h3>
									<p>Encourage women into IT from an earlier age<p>
									<p>I think this will change going forward as more young women have started in technology but need time to work up to higher positions as this has only increased in the last 10-15 years <p>
