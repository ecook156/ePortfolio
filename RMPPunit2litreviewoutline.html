									<h3>What is the focus and aim of your review? Who is your audience?</h3>
									
									<p>Ethics in computing has been a topic of discussion for many years, since the invention of computers there have been concerns around social and ethical issues that the new technology could cause (Johnson & Miller, 2004) and as computers have provided new technology and capabilities, there are choices that must be made on how this technology is used (Moor, 2017) to ensure it is moral and ethical. The need for ethics in computing has resulted in multiple professional bodies producing principles and codes of conduct for how computing professionals should behave within their field such as ACMs Code of Ethics (ACM, 2018) and BCS Code of Conduct (BCS, 2022). Although these codes provide guidance on how computing professionals should behave, there are also issues with ethics that need to be considered. Stahl et al (2016) discusses the key ethical issues and relevant technologies that need to be better understood by relevant stakeholders in the computing profession to ensure the technical experts are aware of the consequences of their work.<p>
