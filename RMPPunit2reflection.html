                  <h2>End of Unit 2 Reflection</h2>
									
									<p>This unit provided further research and discussion into codes of ethics and conducts allowed me to see points of view form other students and analysis whether I agreed or disagreed. My main thoughts on this topic were that while ethics are important they are not defined by law and therefore are hard to measure as they are open to interpretation. This makes it difficult to say whether there is a breach of ethics in the computing profession are people view these codes differently.<p>
                  <p>Initial preparation for the literature review allowed me to choose the topic I wanted to cover and start some initial planning and research into the subject. I enjoyed this as I have chosen an area of interest and importance to me, Iâ€™m interested to keep finding more materials and researching different points of view. As having a special interest in a topic makes this a more enjoyable process and module assignment.<p>
