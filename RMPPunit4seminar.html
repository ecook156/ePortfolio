									<h3>Case Study</h3>
									
									<p>Ricardo works for the records department of his local government as a computer records clerk, where he has access to files of property tax records. For a scientific study, a researcher, Beth, has been granted access to the numerical portion “but not the corresponding names” of some records.<p>
                  <p>Beth finds some information that she would like to use, but she needs the names and addresses corresponding with certain properties. Beth asks Ricardo to retrieve these names and addresses, so she can contact these people for more information and for permission to do further study.<p>
                  <p>Now consider, what are the ethical issues involved in deciding which of these options to pursue?<p>

									<h3>If Ricardo is not responsible for determining allowable access, should he release the names and addresses?</h3>
                  <p>If he is not responsible, then it is not up to him to make this decision<p>
                  
                  <h3>Suppose Ricardo were responsible for determining allowable access to the files. What ethical issues would be involved in his deciding whether to grant access to Beth?</h3>
                  <p>The people will have given consent for their information to be used for tax recording purposes but have not given consent for this information be used for a research study.The data should be used for the specific purpose that it was gathered in the first place and data cannot be disclosed to Beth (a third party) without permission of the individual concerned.<p>
                  
                  <h3>Should Beth be allowed to contact the individuals involved? That is, should the Records department release individuals' names to a researcher? What are the ethical issues for the Records department to consider?</h3>
                  <p>Beth should not be allowed to contact them, by providing her with their names they are breaching their privacy as there is not a legitimate reason for her to have this information. The records department could contact them asking if they can pass their information on and if they give consent then this could be done.<p>
                  
                  <h3>Suppose Beth contacts the individuals to ask their permission, and one-third of them respond giving permission, one-third respond denying permission, and one-third do not respond. Beth claims that at least one-half of the individuals are needed to make a valid study. What options are available to Beth?</h3>
                  <p>Beth can contact the third who gave permission and should not recontact the third that explicitly denied permission. She could recontact the third that did not respond again asking for permission and hope she gets more responses.<p>
