									<h2>Reflection and SWOT Analysis</h2>
								

									<p>Reflecting over the past 12 weeks of the Launching into Cyber Security module my initial reaction is how many new skills I have learnt and the sheer volume of content I have covered in a relatively short space of time.  This module was aptly titles ‘Launching into Cyber Security’ as I felt we were really launched straight into the course, specifically with regards to technical approaches to Cyber Security and programming.<p> 

									
									<p>The below SWOT analysis covers what I have identified to be my strengths and weaknesses specifically to this module and the opportunities and threats that arose throughout the past 12 weeks and how I can use this knowledge to improve my studies further. Reflecting on this below has helped me to focus for the coming module and how I can improve and be more efficient.<p>

									<p>Strengths<p>

									<p>Throughout the first module I have identified 2 major strengths that I want to continue to develop and utilise throughout my MSc.<p>

									<p>1.	Critical writing and academic research<p>

									<p>Throughout this module there have been 3 pieces of written academic work, for all of which I have been extremely happy with my grade and feedback. One of the areas I struggled with at undergraduate level was critically, therefore I knew my focus on this at masters level was required to achieve high grades. I have also focused on in depth wider reading in certain areas where my essays focused in order to provide balanced well researched arguments.<p>

									<p>2.	Application from existing knowledge<p>

									<p>As I currently work in in an information security environment, I have my ability to apply work to my studies and vise versa a strength in helping me to understand the module content in real business context which has enabled me to grasp concepts more easily.<p>

									<p>Weaknesses<p>

									<p>The area I struggled with most during this module was the programming and the programming assignments. Although I enjoyed learning the basics of Python and MYSQL, I found the short space of time to learn quite a challenge and something I need to continue to practice throughout the course, even when not required.<p>

									<p>I feel coming from a non-computing background with no prior knowledge of programming, immediately put me at a disadvantage in this area and was always going to be a weakness from the start. However, although I have found this the most challenging aspect of the course, it is also the area where I have developed and learnt the most.<p>

									<p>Opportunities<p>

									<p>While I have ensured timely completion of all summative assignments throughout the module I want to continue to make use of the opportunity to submit formative assessments for feedback. I managed this in most cases but feel I could have taken better advantage of the opportunity to have feedback on some of my work which would give me more confidence in the summative assignments.<p>

									<p>Threats<p>

									<p>I have found once of the biggest threats throughout this module was the threat of missing some information if I didn’t read everything provided. I trying to spread myself too thin, especially when it came to reading in the first few weeks by trying to complete all of the additional reading as well as doing my own research, however this just meant I was covering a lot of content but maybe not in as much depth as I could. I found that prioritising my time to focus on the new content to me and the areas that would support my assignments more beneficial than reading content which covered topics I was already knowledgeable in.<p>
