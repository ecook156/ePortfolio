									<h2>Reflection Process</h2>
									<p>Reflective writing is considered to be an important feature of student portfolios as without it, a portfolio is just a collection of work with no understanding of the learning process and experience (Kathpalia & Heah, 2008).<p>
                  <p>Throughout the 12-week Network Information Security Management module I have chosen to complete regular reflections at the end of unit 3, unit 5, unit 9 and unit 12. Doing this every few weeks will enable me to concentrate my reflections on a short period of time and allow me to focus on more specific events that happened throughout the previous weeks and units. A study on computer science engineers on a summer internship who completed weekly reflections showed each reflection having measurable significant improvement over time which helped build essential career skills (Minnes et al, 2017). Doing my reflections on a regular basis will also allow me to use the identified evaluations and actions plans to address how I work in the following weeks. This will ensure I am constantly improving and using the reflections to learn from.<p>
                  <p>To complete my reflections, I will be using the theoretical framework Gibbs’ Reflective Cycle (1988) in order to provide structure to my writing by working through each of the 6 stages (Husebo et al, 2015). This will allow all my reflections to be concise, focused and formatted in the same way to allow easy comparison against each other.<p>
