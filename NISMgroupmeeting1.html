									<h2>Meeting 1</h2>
									<p>Our first weekly meeting took place using Google hangouts as gave us the chance to discuss what the next steps and focus areas for our group would be. As team lead, my role was to run the meeting and make sure we covered all required topics, stayed on track and that all team members participated. The meeting lasted around 30 minutes and we we agreed the work to be done ahead of the next weeks team meeting Samuel took meeting notes (evidenced below) and shared with the team via google docs following the call..<p>

									<p>The discussion started with all the members in attendance;<p>

									<p>Samuel, Beth, Jurbe, Isioma<p>

									<p>We discussed two main issues. <p>
									<p>1. Seminar activity preparation: we agreed that we would individually carry out the activity started in unit three of the module. After which, we will update the doc, which Beth will prepare, with our findings and get ready for the upcoming seminar.<p>
