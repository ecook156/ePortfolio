                  <h2>Reflective Activity 2 - Inappropriate Use of Surveys</h2>
                  
									<p>When it comes to conducting research from individuals, which could be in the form of a survey, it is vital that the individuals have given informed consent, which means they understand the role they are playing in the research being gathered and what it will be used for (Dawson, 2015). Not only is this in line with the ACM Code of Ethics principle to be honest and trustworthy (ACM, 2018) but it also ensures that Data is used for the specific purpose of which it was gathered (Data Protection Act, 2018).<p>
                  <p>In the case of Cambridge Analytica, they used data harvested by a third party app through Facebook to target voters during the 2016 presidential election (ICO, 2018), via unauthorised access to more than 87 million users (Isaac & Hanna, 2018). Whilst Facebook had previously tried to implement policies that means app developers had to get consent form users for the use of their data, it was not always followed, and users were not made aware that the information would be used by CA during the electoral campaigns. Although in this case the data was used unethically, research as also shown that Facebook users are unaware of how their information can be used (Eslami et al, 2015) which emphasises the importance of taking time to explain to users how data will be used so they can knowingly give their consent otherwise from a legal perspective consent cannot be given. The way in which this data was supposedly used, to influence voters, also raises moral and social issues in that voting is designed to be a fair democratic process and any potential influence on this destroys that construct. <p>
                  <p>Facebook has had other instances in the past where data has been used inappropriately from their platform. In 2013 they purchased Onavo to gather further analytics around its competitors which was later removed by Apple from the app store before Facebook discontinued use of it (Forbes, 2019). After Apple said it violated their rules of how data was collected it raised concerns around privacy and ethical issues of the data being collected.<p>
