                  <h2>End of Unit 6 Reflection</h2>
									
									<p>This unit was focused around reviewing surveys and questionnaires. Whilst I had previously understood the basics of a questionnaire, I had never given much thought to the difference responses that can be given based on closed vs open questions and the impact that can have on the data collection and whether the data can be quantified or not. As questionnaires are an importance and common approach for market research (Bruce, 2013) it is highly likely this method will be used for the capstone project therefore important to understand this topic in detail. <p>
                  <p>Throughout this unit I continued to work on the literature review, whilst the concepts of the discussion have been decided on, there is a large amount of secondary research to consider ensuring all sides of the arguments are represented to avoud conducting a biased review.<p>
