                  <h2>Research Proposal Evaluation & Reflection</h2>
                  
                  <h3>Description</h3>
									
									<p>For the research proposal presentation, I chose to cover the topic of whether Artificial Intelligence could be used to detect phishing in organisations. I chose a completely different topic to the literature review to remove any chance of self-plagiarism and to delve deeper into another topic. I treated the research in the same way I had the literature review and focused on the detailed research around the topic and the transcript before translating it into a presentation and slides. The review followed a very logical approach with some basic introduction around the topic and then focus on two specific discussion points as well as the research methodologies and ethics considers. The feedback from the assignment was excellent, positive and resulted in the achievement of an overall high grade.<p>
                  
                  <h3>Feelings</h3>
                  
                  <p>Following the feedback from the first assignment, I was quite concerned about this presentation but very keen to take all of the feedback on board and get the best grade possible. I felt very comfortable with the topic of phishing however artificial intelligence was not something I had much prior knowledge of therefore was apprehensive about having to conduct deep research into this area in a very short space of time. However, I was confident what my choice of topic would provide a could discussion base for the presentation and felt by choosing something out of my comfort zone it would offer more of a development opportunity and challenge for me to overcome. I was beyond pleased with the feedback for this assignment after feeling nervous about the outcome based on the previous feedback, I felt proud to have taken the feedback on board and made improvements that amounted to a better grade.<p>
                  
                  <h3>Evaluation</h3>
                  <p>The overall assignment experience went really well, one of the most difficult parts was trying to find balance of good relevant sources as I found most of the research around artificial intelligence was very new and current whereas the academic writing on phishing tended to be older and I wanted to make sure I had newer research of phishing to balance the arguments around artificial intelligence.<p>
                  <p>The way I planned the research proposal worked very well, taking feedback from my literature review, I kept the introduction and description upfront shorter and focused on setting the context then ensured I moved quickly into the in depth critical review. Initially there were going to be three main discussion points covered but I quickly realised that in the time frame allocated I could not cover all of them in detail therefore decided to only focus on two discussion topics ensuring the criticality was thorough. <p>
                  <p>The biggest challenge for this assignment was researching the artificial intelligence element which I had very little prior knowledge of, at one stage of the assignment I was tempted to change my research topic as I didn’t want this to be a detriment to the application of knowledge grading criteria, however I had already spent a significant time planning the content and felt it would be more damaging to change ideas. The feedback for all areas of this assignment was excellent and outstanding and the grade was a huge improvement on the literature review.<p>

                  <h3>Analysis</h3>
                  <p>Pushing myself to learn about a new topic for this research proposal was challenging however on completion felt more rewarding than if a topic with prior knowledge had been chosen, as I had the ability to teach myself, and research into a new area to add to my knowledge base. Whilst the overall feedback for the assignment was excellent and outstanding, the two areas where marks were slightly less were knowledge and critically, therefore there is still some room for improvement. Thought there was a transcript provided, I feel if the template for this research proposal had been another literature review I could have excelled further in these areas as there would have been less of a focus on presentation. <p>
                  <p>The biggest achievement for this assignment was the overall improvement from the feedback from the literature review to the outcome of this proposal, this shows that I had understood the comments made, areas for improvement and did as much as I could in three weeks to ensure this assignment was better and proving that I can achieve a high grade for this type of research writing. <p>
                  
                  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                  <p>Overall, the research proposal presentation process was effective at preparing me for the capstone project. Research was appropriately carried out and used to critical discuss the topics chosen and then presented in a logical and structure was with clear presenting skills. The improvement in grade, from the previous assignment, demonstrated new skills and feedback had been taken on board and can be carried on to the capstone project to ensure success.<p>
                  
                  <h3>Action Plan</h3>
                  <p>•	Continue to develop critical discussion writing skills with even more depth and opposing views.<p>
                  <p>•	Undertake further research and learning into artificial intelligence to improve my knowledge base ahead for the capstone project. <p>
                  <p>•	Effectively plan discussion topics at the start of the project to ensure time is not wasted on an area that then needs to be removed due to word count constraints.<p>
                  <p>•	Review both sets of assignment feedback prior to starting the capstone project to remind myself of the areas to focus on for improvement. <p>
